(Enbridge) submitted an application (the Application) to the National Energy Board (NEB) for approval to construct and operate the Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project (the Project). The Project consists of the construction and operation of approximately 35 km of 508.0 mm O.D. (NPS 20) replacement pipeline and the decommissioning in-place of approximately 32 km of 323.9 mm O.D. (NPS 12) of existing pipeline in southern Ontario from Enbridgeâs existing Westover Terminal to the existing Nanticoke Junction Facility. The replacement pipeline will be constructed within a construction right-of-way (ROW) comprised of a permanent easement and temporary workspace. The existing Line 10 pipeline will be decommissioned and, in accordance with Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Z662-15, be cleaned, isolated, left in place, and will be subject to ongoing monitoring. The pipeline will be placed in either the existing easement or new easement acquired adjacent to the existing easement. Pending regulatory approval, construction is anticipated to commence in Q3 2017 and be in-service by Q1 2018. Enbridge commissioned CH2M HILL Energy Canada, Ltd. (CH2M) to prepare an Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment (ESA) in collaboration with Dillon Consulting Limited (Dillon), which was submitted to the NEB in association with the Application on December 4, 2015. 1.1 Objectives Since writing the ESA, additional work has been completed on the Project. On April 18, 2016, Enbridge filed an ESA Update outlining supplemental environmental survey information [Filing ID A4Z3Z4] and update to consultation and engagement activities [Filing ID A4Z3Z3]. On July 15, 2016, Enbridge filed a Project-specific Preliminary Environmental Protection Plan (EPP) and an updated Environmental Alignment Sheet (EAS) Package [Filing ID A5D8Y1 and A5D8Y2]. The EPP and EAS were prepared using routing information that was updated since the initial Application was filed in December 2015. The same updated routing information has been used to prepare this Supplemental ESA. A summary of the route revisions along the replacement pipeline route since the Application was filed is provided in Section 2.1 and detailed on Figures 1A to 1G. As such, the resource-specific measures provided in the EPP and EAS are inclusive of the updated routing information and are consistent with this Supplemental ESA. The objective of this document is to provide the NEB with supplemental information related to updates to the Project and ESA. Specifically, the intent of this document is to provide the following information: â¢ A summary of changes to Project details regarding the proposed replacement pipeline and facilities (Section 2.0) â¢ A summary of the environmental and socio-economic consultation and engagement activities conducted since March 2016 (Section 3.0) â¢ A review of field-based information that has been collected since the ESA was filed (Section 4.0) â¢ A summary of the environmental and socio-economic considerations resulting from changes to the Project details, ongoing consultation and engagement and results of 2016 environmental field surveys (Section 5.0) â¢ An evaluation of the potential effects and cumulative effects assessment completed for the Project considering the changes to Project details, updated consultation and engagement, 2016 field studies, NEB Information Request commitments and changes to the proposed mitigation (Section 6.0) â¢ An update on remaining supplemental field studies for the Project (Section 7.0).

Enbridge will continue to evaluate Project design and routing options as further consultation and Project design work are undertaken. As such, further route refinements may be warranted as a result ongoing Project planning (including consideration of the results of ongoing stakeholder consultation, Aboriginal engagement, and field surveys). Locations along the Line 10 replacement pipeline route are referred to by Kilometer Post (KP). KPs are numbered sequentially starting at KP 0.0 at the Westover Terminal and ending at KP 35.8, just beyond the existing Nanticoke Facility. KPs reported below, in the EAS [Filing ID A5D8Y2] and Resource-Specific Mitigation Tables (Appendix O of the EPP [Filing ID A5D8Y1]) have accounted for changes due to the route revisions listed below. A summary of each route revision, including the start and end points, and the rationale is provided in Table 2-1. Corresponding figures are provided in Figures 1A to 1G in Appendix 1. Table 2-1.

The Project Footprint (Footprint) is made up of the area directly disturbed by Project construction and clean-up activities, including associated physical works and activities (i.e., construction ROW, permanent facilities, temporary facilities, temporary workspace and additional temporary workspace). The need for an additional 2 m of temporary workspace associated with the construction ROW has been identified. As a result, it is anticipated that the construction ROW will typically be approximately 35 m wide, comprised of 10 m of permanent easement and 25 m of temporary workspace. A summary of the changes since the ESA was submitted (i.e., December 2015) in length and Footprint resulting from route revisions is provided in Table 2-2. Table 2-2. Summary of Changes in Length and Footprint Resulting from Route Revisions and Changes to Temporary Workspace Element Project Detail â December 2015 Project Detail â Current Total Replacement Pipeline Footprint 135 ha 162 ha Permanent Easement Footprint 36 ha 29 ha Temporary Workspace Footprint 99 ha 133 ha Total Replacement Pipeline Length Approximately 35 km Approximately 35.8 km 2.2 Permanent Facilities Permanent facilities associated with the Project remain the same as initially identified in Section 2.5 of the ESA submitted to the NEB in December 2015 [Filing ID A4W2R0]. 2.3 Temporary Infrastructure and Workspace In addition to revisions to temporary workspace associated with the construction ROW, ongoing Project planning has also identified the need for revisions to extra temporary workspace (e.g., equipment staging areas). As a result of the revisions, the area of temporary workspace associated with the Project is approximately 133 ha. Changes to temporary workspace are not considered route revisions and are therefore not discussed further. However, the changes to temporary workspace have been considered in the assessment of changes to the Project below, are currently depicted on the EAS filed in July 2016 and will be revised in the EAS Package issued prior to construction. 2.4 Line 10 Decommissioning A Decommissioning Environmental Technical Report was filed with the Application [Filing ID A4W2T9]. An updated Decommissioning Environmental Technical Report is provided in Appendix 3 and includes the following information. â¢ Revised anticipated segmentation locations â¢ Revised site-specific mitigation measures â¢ Updated information regarding decommissioning treatment â¢ Specified use of cut and cap as a means of segmenting the pipeline â¢ Incorporation of land use assessment â¢ Inclusion of decommissioning environmental alignment sheets A complete list of changes and associated rationale has been included as a concordance table in the revised report. Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project OH-001-2016 Supplemental ESA - Part 1 of 3 Page 8 of 57 Filed August 15, 2016 ","SECTION 3.0 CH2M HILL ENERGY CANADA, LTD. 3-1 3.0 Consultation and Engagement Update 3.1 Government and Non-Government Consultation Enbridge consulted with stakeholders and engaged with Aboriginal groups to share updated Project information, and to obtain input on the Project design and ESA requirements. Sections 4.0 and 5.0 of the Application [Filing ID A4W2K6 and A4W2T4] and Section 3.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0] included the results of Enbridgeâs consultation and engagement efforts starting in 2013 up to and including November 30, 2015. Additionally, Enbridge filed a Stakeholder Consultation Update [Filing ID A4Z3Z2] and an Aboriginal Engagement Update [Filing ID A4Z3Z3] on April 28, 2016 which included information regarding consultation efforts since the Application filing in December 2015 up to and including March 2016. This section provides information on the stakeholder consultation and Aboriginal engagement programs for the Project conducted up to and including July 28, 2016. Interests identified during recent consultation and engagement efforts are noted in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.3.3. 3.2 Stakeholder Consultation Enbridge remains committed to ongoing consultation throughout the lifecycle of the Project. Enbridge continues to provide accurate and timely Project information to stakeholders, as well as gather stakeholder feedback through a series of open houses and meetings with local government agencies (regulators), presentations/speaking opportunities, and email engagement. Landowners and Tenants. Enbridge has met, and continues to meet and engage, with directly affected landowners. Topics of consultation include, but are not limited to, ongoing surveys and providing Project updates, as applicable. Enbridge has also met with adjacent landowners or stakeholders who have contacted Enbridge directly in response to engagement opportunities or where temporary access was needed for field surveys along the replacement pipeline route. Consultation will continue throughout the various Project stages. Consultation with Other Stakeholders. Enbridge has maintained continuous dialogue and consultation efforts with the environmental regulators and municipalities along the Project ROW since the onset of the Project (i.e., prior to the Application submission) and has continued to provide the municipalities affected by the Project with opportunities to review Project plans and provide feedback. A summary of recent governmental and non-governmental consultation related to environmental and socio-economic matters (e.g., heritage resources) is provided below in Table 3-1. As part of the ongoing Public Consultation Program for the Project, Enbridge continues to monitor and respond to comments/inquiries made via the Project toll-free line and email address provided to stakeholders. Affected and adjacent landowners and all other stakeholders will continue to receive regular Project updates. 3.3 Aboriginal Engagement Through correspondence, discussions and meetings, there have been opportunities for engaged Aboriginal communities to identify specific interests with the Project. Enbridge will continue to discuss all issues and concerns that have been brought forward and will continue to work with Aboriginal communities to resolve Project-related concerns. Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project OH-001-2016 Supplemental ESA - Part 1 of 3 Page 9 of 57 Filed August 15, 2016 ","SECTION 3.0 â CONSULTATION AND ENGAGEMENT UPDATE 3-2 CH2M HILL ENERGY CANADA, LTD. 3.3.1 Six Nations of the Grand River On April 18, 2016, Enbridge submitted an Aboriginal Engagement Update [Filing ID A4Z3Z3]. Recently, the Six Nations of the Grand River (Six Nations) filed an affidavit with the NEB on June 20, 2016 [Filing ID A77766] stating that Six Nations is concerned the Project may impact traditional deer hunting in the vicinity of Copetown Woods Golf Club and that there has not been an impact assessment evaluation on deer habitat. No specific concerns about traditional deer hunting were raised by Six Nations during previous engagement opportunities. Enbridge continues to meet with Six Nations to discuss traditional land use practices that may be impacted by the Project. Six Nations' representatives inquired about a Traditional Knowledge Study that would contemplate the impact of all projects and operations by Enbridge within Six Nations' asserted treaty and/or traditional territory, however at this time, Six Nations has not expressed that such a study is necessary for the Project. In fact, Enbridge and Six Nations met previously to discuss an overview of the environmental assessment process, potential impacts, and key mitigation measures for wildlife, fish habitat and watercourse crossing management. On June 8, 2016, both parties signed a Line 10 Capacity Funding Agreement to facilitate Six Nationsâ participation in the Project. Through such funding, Enbridge intends for Six Nations to consult with Enbridge on the Project and subsequently provide relevant input. In the fall of 2015, both parties executed an Archaeological Monitoring Agreement and, as such, Six Nations monitors are currently participating in the archaeological work being carried out for the Project. Enbridge is continuing to proactively engage in meaningful discussions with Six Nations to address any concerns about potential impacts on Haudenosaunee (Six Nations) practices. 3.3.2 Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation In early March 2016, the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation (MNCFN) expressed an interest in being involved in the environmental field surveys planned for the Project. As such, Enbridge and MNCFN signed an Environmental Participation Agreement in April 2016 and an MNCFN representative has been actively participating in the environmental field surveys. To date, MNCFN has participated in soil sampling, wildlife surveys, fish habitat assessments, butternut health assessments, and fish surveys. No new issues or concerns were identified during survey participation. In June 2016, Enbridge and the MNCFN executed a Line 10 Capacity Funding Agreement in order to facilitate meaningful engagement with the community on the Project, as well as provide input into the Project. Through discussions for the Line 10 Capacity Funding Agreement, MNCFN noted general interests including, wildlife and wildlife habitat, vegetation (e.g., white pine needles), and water quality. No new issues or concerns were raised by MNCFN that were not previously identified in the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0]. MNCFN participated in 2016 field investigations as Environmental Monitors. MNCFN are interested in participating in future field surveys for the Project. Additionally, Enbridge has maintained an open line of communication for MNCFN inquiries about specific survey methodology and interpretation, such as soil sampling. 3.3.3 Haudenosaunee Development Institute In March 2016, Enbridge met with the Haudenosaunee Development Institute (HDI) to discuss environmental surveys and potential environmental impacts as well as to provide a presentation regarding Enbridgeâs approach to environmental assessments and reporting. When given the opportunity to ask questions or voice concerns, HDI chose not to. HDI did request an opportunity to participate in environmental field surveys for the Project, and Enbridge and HDI have had discussions Enbridge Pipelines Inc.

HDI has also been actively participating on-site as archaeology monitors since November 2015 and continue to participate in the archeology fieldwork. 3.3.1 MÃ©tis Nation of Ontario There have been no engagement activities with the MÃ©tis Nation of Ontario since the update filed on April 28, 2016 [Filing ID A4Z3Z3]. As outlined in that update, MÃ©tis Nation of Ontario do not assert Aboriginal rights in the Project area but are interested in potential employment and economic opportunities and wish to be kept updated on Project milestones. Enbridge has and will continue to provide MÃ©tis Nation of Ontario with Project updates. 3.3.2 Summary Enbridge will continue to actively engage with all identified Aboriginal communities in meaningful dialogue for the purposes of exchanging information regarding the Project, responding to inquiries, hearing and responding to any interests or concerns that may arise, as well as participating in ongoing dialogue about the Project. Should an Aboriginal community that has not been previously engaged identify itself as being affected by the Project, Enbridge will engage with that Aboriginal group. Enbridge Pipelines Inc.

Several environmental studies have been completed, starting in December 2015 and continuing throughout spring and summer 2016. Since certain study locations resulted in confidential species at risk observations, select study locations are provided in Appendix 2. 4.1 Soil and Soil Productivity Soil sampling occurred along the replacement pipeline ROW in April and May 2016 using standard soil procedures (Denholm and Schut, 1993) for landscapes encountered by the replacement pipeline route (e.g., farms, stream catchment). Information gathered during soil sampling included: â¢ the depth, texture and colour of the topsoil layer or plough layer; â¢ the texture and colour of the subsoil layer; â¢ the presence or absence of mottles or grey gley colours; â¢ the presence of hard pan, gravels, and/or stones, or bedrock that is close to, or at, the surface; and â¢ the presence or absence of free moisture. Soil sampling was conducted at a Level 2, or detailed intensity level, based on Specifications for Soil Survey Intensity (Survey Order) in Canada (Valentine and Lidstone, 1985). Sampling occurred at approximately 200 m intervals excluding woodlands, wetlands, areas where horizontal directional drilling (HDD) is proposed, in close proximity to roads, or in areas overlapping with soil sampling for the recent Line 11 Westover Replacement Project (see Figure 2). All soil sampling results are provided in Table 1 of Appendix O of the preliminary EPP [Filing ID A5D8Y1] and have been used to support recommendations regarding soil lifts and handling procedures. 4.2 Vegetation 4.2.1 Rare Plant Survey Rare plant surveys were completed in May and June 2016 where suitable habitat was identified. Surveys were completed in areas where multi-season vegetation surveys were not previously completed in 2013 due to late property access and in areas in areas where the route has been refined since previous vegetation surveys (see Figure 2). Butternut ( Juglans cinerea ), a species at risk, was identified at multiple locations. Due to the sensitive nature of these records, specific location details have not been provided. Late season vegetation surveys will be completed where access was not granted in 2013 and along route revision areas in August or early September 2016, as outlined in Section 7.1. All results of the rare plant surveys conducted to date are presented in Table 5 of Appendix O of the preliminary EPP [Filing ID A5D8Y1]. These results will be used to inform protection measures, including contingency plans, for butternut as well as other plant species at risk in the event additional rare plants are discovered during construction.

Weed species observed during 2016 surveys along the replacement pipeline route include meadow fescue ( Schedonorus pratensis ), common reed ( Phragmites australis ), hybrid cattail ( Typha x glauca ), poison ivy ( Toxicodendron radicans ), reed canary grass ( Phalaris arundinacea ), Kentucky bluegrass ( Poa pratensis ), garlic mustard ( Allaria petiolata ), sweet coltsfoot ( Tussilago farfara ), tall fescue ( Schedonorus arundinaceus ), yellow sweet-clover ( Melilotus officinalis ), Canada thistle ( Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop. ) , and crown vetch ( Securigera varia ). Field survey methodology and weed classifications are provided in the Biosecurity Management Plan included as Appendix G of the preliminary EPP [Filing ID A5D8Y1]. To prevent the transfer of weeds, recommended vehicle cleaning locations are provided in Table 6 of Appendix O in the preliminary EPP [Filing ID A5D8Y1]. 4.2.3 Tree and Woodland Surveys To support municipal regulatory approvals required for the removal of trees along the replacement pipeline route, a field inventory and assessment of tree stands was conducted for all trees that may require removal during construction of the Project. Data collected from the inventory and assessment are included in an Arborist Report along with supplementary documentation that will be submitted to the City of Hamilton. Inventories and assessments were completed between late May and late June 2016 during the leaf-on period under the supervision of an International Society of Aboriculture Certified Arborist (see Figure 2). The area of focus for the tree surveys included those stands of trees on private property that may be subject to the City of Hamiltonâs Woodland Conservation Bylaw No. R00-054 (e.g., stands equal or greater than 0.81 ha). Tree and woodland surveys conducted along the replacement pipeline route included collecting the following information. â¢ The identification of tree species, specifically designated as species at risk (e.g., American chestnut and butternut) â¢ An inventory of diameter-at-breast-height (DBH) (i.e., 1.38 m from the ground) measurements â¢ An assessment of stand condition health â¢ Documentation of emerald ash borer and/or evidence of infestation in ash trees â¢ Any recommendations regarding removal, protection or preservation, if determinable Additionally, tree surveys within municipal road ROWs were completed in April 2016 where individual trees are subject to the City of Hamilton Bylaw No. 06-151 To Regulate the Planting, Maintenance, and Preservation of Trees on or Affecting Public Property (i.e., trees within public road ROWs). Trees within municipal road ROWs were surveyed on both sides of the road along the full width of temporary work space areas where tree clearing is required for construction crews to access both sides of the road. Through discussion with the City of Hamilton (see Table 3-1), it was determined that trees within the municipal road ROWs will need to be individually tagged. The following information was recorded: species, DBH, health, ownership (public or private), and recommendations to preserve or remove. An arborist report for trees in municipal road ROWs was submitted to the City of Hamilton and a permit was received in June 2016. The City of Hamilton reviewed the field assessment and tree surveys completed for the Project and additional surveys are not required, as outlined in the in the ESA Update [Filing ID A4Z3Z4] filed in April 2016.

Vegetation was characterized using the ELC System for Southern Ontario (Lee at al., 1998). Field data was used to classify vegetation and assist with the identification of wildlife habitats. All vegetation communities surveyed during 2016 field studies are considered very common in Ontario. 4.3 Fish and Fish Habitat Fish habitat assessments were completed at crossings along the replacement pipeline route in areas where the route has been refined since previous surveys and/or where access was not previously granted. Methodology was consistent with the previous surveys conducted for the Project in 2013 and 2015. Habitat assessments evaluated flow permanency and physical characteristics at each crossing including waterbody type, channel size, habitat availability and type of fish, and potential barriers to fish movement. Assessments were completed at each crossing as well as 50 m upstream and 50 m downstream, where access was available. As noted in the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0], five watercourse crossings were identified from desktop surveys but not previously assessed in the field (i.e., WC 18, 36, 37, 39, and 40). These watercourses were visited in 2016 to determine physical habitat characteristics. Watercourses 18 and 39 were determined to not be watercourses during site visits and WC 37 is no longer crossed by the replacement pipeline route, therefore these features have been removed from the listing of watercourses provided in Table 2 of Appendix O in the preliminary EPP [Filing ID A5D8Y1]. Assessments were completed for WC 36 and 40 and site-specific information is provided in Table 2 of Appendix O in the preliminary EPP [Filing ID A5D8Y1]. An additional assessment will be completed in August 2016 to confirm flow permanency at these crossings, as outlined in Section 7.1. 4.3.1 Fish Community Surveys Fish community surveys were completed at six watercourse crossings that were identified as having the potential for fish species at risk (i.e., WC 48, 50, 52, 54, 58 and 59) (see Figure 2). Fish were captured at three of the six watercourses surveyed (i.e., WC 48, 52 and 59). All fish captured were warmwater common species including black crappie ( Pomoxis nigromaculatus ), Johnny darter ( Etheostoma nigrum ), fathead minnow ( Pimephales promelas ), pumpkinseed ( Lepomis gibbosus ) and central mudminnow ( Umbra limi ). There were no species at risk caught or observed during the 2016 fish community surveys. Habitat suitability for grass pickerel was identified during 2016 surveys at one watercourse crossing (WC 52). In addition, an assessment was completed for the relocated crossing of Big Creek (WC 20), and for an ephemeral watercourse (WC 71) and an intermittent watercourse (WC 72) that were subsequently identified on portions of the proposed replacement pipeline route. 4.3.2 DFO Self-Assessments There are 10 Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Self-Assessments included in Appendix 4 of this report. Four are new assessments that were not previously completed due to access constraints and/or due to route refinements (WC 36, 40, 71 and 72). The remaining six DFO Self-Assessments were updated since the initial Application (see Appendix 4 of the ESA [Filing IDs A4W2U5, A4W2U5, A4W2U6 and A4W2U7]) based on the results of 2016 field surveys. Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project OH-001-2016 Supplemental ESA - Part 1 of 3 Page 25 of 57 Filed August 15, 2016 ","SECTION 4.0 â UPDATE ON ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES 4-4 CH2M HILL ENERGY CANADA, LTD. Grass pickerel habitat was previously identified in the Local Study Area (LSA) defined for the Project during an initial desktop review of the anticipated replacement pipeline route (DFO 2015, Durley 2006, Morrison Hershfield Limited 2012, Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority 2011) resulting in DFO Self-Assessments for WC 48, 52, 55 and 56. Aquatic species at risk mapping (Conservation Ontario, 2015) indicates that there is no potential for grass pickerel habitat at watercourses 55 and 56 and revised DFO Self-Assessments and DFO reviews are therefore not warranted. Suitable habitat for grass pickerel was identified during 2016 surveys at one watercourse crossing (WC 52). 4.4 Wetlands Field surveys were completed in June 2016 at wetlands located along route revisions and areas where access was not granted in 2013 and 2015 (see Figure 2). Wetlands were evaluated using the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) and delineated based on OWES methodology. As the majority of wetlands that overlap with the pipeline replacement route have been previously evaluated by the MNRF to be provincially significant, it is assumed that wetlands not currently evaluated by the MNRF (i.e., unevaluated wetlands as per Land Information Ontario mapping) will be âcomplexedâ into existing Provincially Significant Wetlands. As a result, further wetland evaluations were not completed. Provincially significant wetlands that the replacement pipeline route crosses include the Sheffield-Rockton, the Hayesland-Christie and the Big Creek Headwaters complexes. There are a total of 24 wetlands crossed or located within 50 m of the current replacement pipeline route and/or temporary workspace, as outlined in Table 4 of Appendix O of the EPP [Filing ID A5D8Y1]. 4.5 Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat 4.5.1 Bat Cavity Surveys Deciduous and/or mixed woodlands along the replacement pipeline route were targeted during the bat snag surveys in order to help identify bat maternity colony roosts. Bat snag surveys were conducted along the replacement pipeline ROW in deciduous and/or mixed woodland areas that will require vegetation clearing (i.e., snag survey areas). Surveys were typically conducted within a 50 m area (i.e., approximately 25 m on both sides of the centerline). In consultation with MNRF, survey methodology was adapted from applicable guidelines (MNR, 2011) for the Project area to establish larger snag surveys and increase the degree of survey effort resulting in more accurate results within the woodland areas. A total of 24 woodlands along the replacement pipeline route were subject to snag surveys in December 2015 and April and May 2016. The snag surveys were conducted during the âleaf-off periodâ in order to view tree cavities and crevices not obscured by foliage. Surveyed woodlands found to have a snag density â¥10 snag /cavity trees per hectare are considered to be Assumed Significant Bat Maternity Roosting Habitats (MNR, 2000; MNRF, 2011, 2015). A total of two Assumed Significant Bat Maternity Roosting Habitats have been identified. Results of the bat snag surveys are provided in Table 3 of Appendix O of the preliminary EPP [Filing ID A5D8Y1] and have been used to support species-specific mitigation measures. 4.5.2 Turtles Turtle basking surveys were conducted in one location (see Figure 2) on the replacement pipeline route identified as having high potential for turtle habitat based on consultation with the MNRF. Surveys followed the Blandingâs Turtle Protocol provided by the MNRF. Five visits were completed in late April and early May 2016 under ideal weather conditions. There were no Blandingâs turtles detected during field surveys. Snapping turtles ( Chelydra serpentina ) were observed during four of the visits and more Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project OH-001-2016 Supplemental ESA - Part 1 of 3 Page 26 of 57 Filed August 15, 2016 ","SECTION 4.0 â UPDATE ON ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES CH2M HILL ENERGY CANADA, LTD. 4-5 than 20 midland painted turtles ( Chrysemys picta marginata ) were observed on two occasions. Therefore, this habitat is considered Significant Turtle Habitat and Significant Habitat for Snapping Turtle (MNRF, 2000; MNRF, 2015). 4.5.3 Amphibians Amphibian breeding surveys were completed in 12 locations identified as providing suitable habitat along the replacement pipeline route. Surveys were conducted between April and June 2016 to detect the presence or absence of early, mid, and late season breeding frogs and toads. Surveys occurred between dusk and midnight on nights with minimal or no precipitation and low wind speeds. Species type and abundance was documented to determine potential amphibian breeding habitats. Of the 12 potential habitats surveyed, 4 are considered Significant Amphibian Breeding Habitat (MNRF, 2000; MNRF, 2015). No amphibian species at risk were detected. Species observed include spring peeper ( Pseudacris crucifer ), northern leopard frog ( Lithobates pipiens ), American toad ( Anaxyrus americanus ), gray treefrog ( Hyla versicolor ), green frog ( Lithobates clamitans ) and bull frog ( Lithobates catesbeianus ). 4.5.3.1 Jefferson Salamander Jefferson salamander pond suitability studies were completed in two areas in April and June 2016 where access was available. At the request of the MNRF, the survey methodology cannot be included in publicly available documents; however, surveys followed the protocol provided by MNRF. Shallow vernal pools were observed during the first visit in the two woodland/wetland areas. During the second visit, all vernal pools were found to be dry; therefore, a third visit was not required. Due to property access restrictions, a section of one natural feature was not surveyed in 2016, therefore, it could not be confirmed if this area contains habitat features suitable for Jefferson salamander and is assumed to be potential habitat. Consultation with MNRF regarding field investigations and habitat suitability is ongoing and pre-construction surveys will be conducted to confirm the presence or absence of Jefferson salamander habitat in this area. Due to the sensitive nature of this record, location details have not been provided. 4.5.4 Breeding Birds Breeding bird surveys were conducted at 17 locations with natural habitats identified along the replacement pipeline route and route refinement locations where access was not granted in 2013 or where both survey visits were not initially able to be completed (see Figure 2). Surveys followed methods outlined in the Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas Guide for Participants (Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas, 2001) with surveys conducted over two visits during the peak of the breeding bird season (between late May and the first week of July). Survey visits were completed in May and June 2016. Results of breeding bird surveys will be used to establish a baseline assessment for the Project area prior to construction. Fourteen habitats contain species at risk (e.g., eastern wood-pewee [ Contopus virens ] , wood thrush [ Hylocichla mustelina ], bobolink [ Dolichonyx oryzivorus ], eastern meadowlark [ Sturnella magna ] and common nighthawk [ Chordeiles minor ]) and/or Significant Wildlife Habitat (MNRF, 2000; MNRF, 2015). 4.5.4.1 Crepuscular Bird Surveys Crepuscular Bird Surveys were completed at 19 locations along the replacement pipeline route (see Figure 2). Two survey visits were completed between mid-May and the end of June 2016 when the moon phase was greater than 50%, above the horizon and not obscured by clouds. Common nighthawk ( Chordeiles minor ), a species at risk, was identified at four locations. Due to the sensitive nature of these records, location details have not been provided. Enbridge Pipelines Inc.

Bobolink and/or eastern meadowlark were observed in three of these hayfields during field surveys conducted in 2013 and are considered to be confirmed habitat for these species and repeat surveys were not required. Three hayfields that were considered to be potential habitat identified in 2013 and 2015 have since become row crops and are no longer considered suitable habitat. Therefore, 2016 surveys were not conducted in these areas. Additionally, an HDD is anticipated at another hayfield, thereby avoiding the potential habitat and removing the requirement for surveys at this location. Field surveys were conducted during late May and early July 2016 in the remaining seven hayfields that were identified as moderate or high potential habitat for bobolink and/or eastern meadowlark (see Figure 2). These species were identified in four hayfields, thus these fields are considered to be confirmed habitat, totaling seven confirmed habitats along the replacement pipeline route. 4.6 Species at Risk Species at risk is defined to include those that are federally-listed under Schedule 1 of the Species at Risk Act or by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), or are provincially-listed under the Ontario Endangered Species Act . Field survey results related to wildlife, vegetation and aquatic species at risk are provided in Section 4.5, Section 4.2 and Section 4.3, respectively. Status ranking for species at risk with the potential to interact with the Project are provided in Section 5.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0] and Appendix 2A of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2T9]. 4.7 Heritage Resources Enbridge continues to conduct a Stage 2 archaeological assessment along the proposed pipeline ROW, and in consultation with MTCS, has begun Stage 3 archaeological assessment work. Results of the archaeological assessments will be used to support mitigation measures for the protection of heritage resources (e.g., archaeological, palaeontological or historical sites) to be implemented during construction. 4.8 Traditional Land and Resource Use 4.8.1 Medicinal Plants Six Nations previously identified plant species considered to be medicinal, including strawberry, tobacco, plantain, raspberry root, and jewelweed. Field investigations identified multiple species of strawberry ( Fragaria spp. ), plantain, raspberry ( Rubus spp. ) and jewelweed (touch-me-nots; Impatiens spp .) along the replacement pipeline route. These species are considered common and secure in Ontario (NatureServe, 2015) and are widely available in the greater Project area. Tobacco has not been identified along the replacement pipeline route and was not identified during field investigations. Additionally, MNCFN are interested in white pine ( Pinus strobus ) that was identified along the replacement pipeline route in multiple woodlands. Enbridge will work with landowners along the pipeline ROW where white pine removal is required for pipeline construction. Enbridge Pipelines Inc.

All realignments due to route revisions are within 30 m of the previously proposed locations and in similar habitat, and are located in the same environmental setting previously described in Section 5.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0] (e.g., the same waterbodies and watershed information). The crossing method for three watercourses changed from isolated open cut to HDD (one HDD encompassing all three watercourses). A summary of the watercourse crossings affected by the route revision from KP 8.6 to KP 9.9 is provided in Table 6-1 and physical characteristics of the watercourses are provided in Table 2 of Appendix O in the preliminary EPP [Filing ID A5D8Y1]. Wetlands This route revision crosses one wetland complex that was previously encountered and is now crossed in a different location within the same complex from KP 9.1 to KP 9.2. This wetland is part of the Big Creek Headwaters complex which is described in Section 5.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0]. Vegetation This route revision crosses cultivated land which has limited potential to support rare plant habitat. The route revision also encounters shrub and treed vegetation which may provide habitat for rare plants and has been previously described in Section 5.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0] and Appendix 2A of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2S8 and A4W2T2]. No new rare plants were identified during 2016 vegetation surveys. Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat/Species at Risk The route revision crosses Breeding Bird Habitat identified as Significant Wildlife Habitat for Special Concern and Rare Wildlife Species for eastern wood-pewee and wood thrush, as well as Significant Amphibian Breeding Habitat (i.e., presence of two or more amphibian species with 20 or more breeding individuals). This habitat is similar to what was previously described in Section 5.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0] and Appendix 2A of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2T2, A4W2T6 and A4W2T9]. 11.2 12.4 Cultivated, treed, open water The environmental and socio-economic setting associated with this route revision is consistent with that previously described in Section 5.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0] and Appendix 2A of the ESA for this section of the replacement pipeline route with the exception of the following elements. Water Quality and Quantity The pipeline was realigned at the watercourse crossing at Big Creek approximately 200 m downstream in a ponded setting. The crossing method changed from isolated open cut to HDD. The watercourse crossing is located in the same environmental setting previously described in Section 5.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0] (e.g., the same waterbodies and watershed information). Fish and Fish Habitat The watercourse crossing of Big Creek for the route revision has been relocated 200 m downstream to a ponded section of the watercourse at KP 11.9 (Appendix 4). A fish habitat assessment was conducted at the new crossing location and physical characteristics of the watercourse at this location are provided in Table 2 of Appendix O of the EPP [Filing ID A5D8Y1]. The realignment is located in the same environmental setting previously described in Section 5.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0] (e.g., the same waterbodies and watershed information).

Vegetation This route revision crosses cultivated land which provides limited rare plant habitat. The route revision also crosses treed vegetation which may provide habitat for rare plants and has been previously described in Section 5.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0]. No new rare plants were identified during 2016 vegetation surveys. Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat/Species at Risk The route revision crosses forest and wetland habitat associated with Big Creek, which provides Significant Wildlife Habitat for Special Concern and Rare Wildlife Species (eastern wood-pewee), Significant Woodland Area-Sensitive Bird Breeding Habitat, Significant Turtle Habitat and Significant Habitat for Snapping Turtles. This habitat is similar to what was previously described in Section 5.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0] and Appendix 2A of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2T2, A4W2T6 and A4W2T9]. The route revision will avoid interaction with the Stratum 2 deer wintering area associated with the Big Creek wetland complex, previously described in Section 5.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0]. This deer wintering area is now crossed by the Project in only one location (KP 14.1 to 14.2) and is similar to what was previously described in Section 5.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0] and Appendix 2A of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2T2, A4W2T6 and A4W2T9]. This area is not a provincially designated Significant Wildlife Habitat. 13.0 13.3 Cultivated The environmental and socio-economic setting associated with this route revision is consistent with that previously described in Section 5.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0] and Appendix 2A of the ESA for this section of the replacement pipeline route. 19.6 20.5 Cultivated, tame pasture, treed The environmental and socio-economic setting associated with this route revision is consistent with that previously described in Section 5.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0] and Appendix 2A of the ESA for this section of the replacement pipeline route with the exception of the following elements. Water Quality and Quantity The pipeline was realigned at the watercourse crossing at one tributary (WC 35) to Big Creek approximately 10 m upstream, and the watercourse crossing at another tributary of Big Creek (WC 36) approximately 250 m upstream. The watercourse crossings are located in the same environmental setting previously described in Section 5.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0] (e.g., the same waterbodies and watershed information).

Water Quality and Quantity The watercourse crossing (WC 69) was initially crossed by a temporary access road and is now crossed by the replacement pipeline route as a result of this route revision. The watercourse crossing is located in the same environmental setting previously described in Section 5.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0] (e.g., the same waterbodies and watershed information). This route revision resulted in two fewer water wells and four additional water wells located within the LSA defined for the Project (500 m on both sides of the centre line) (MOECC, 2013). Fish and Fish Habitat Fish habitat at WC 69 was previously assessed when this location was anticipated to be a temporary construction access road. Physical characteristics of the watercourse are provided in Table 2 of Appendix O in the preliminary EPP [Filing ID A5D8Y1]. The watercourse crossing is located in the same environmental setting previously described in Section 5.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0] (e.g., the same waterbodies and watershed information).

Changes to the environmental and socio-economic setting resulting from changes to Project details are provided in Section 5.0. However, overall, the environmental and socio-economic setting is generally consistent with that previously described in the ESA. The results of the effects and cumulative effects assessment conducted for all elements are not anticipated to change as a result of the changes to Project details, updated consultation and engagement, updated mitigation, or from the results of supplemental fieldwork. The 2016 field survey results and route revision locations did not alter the general environmental and socio-economic setting for physical and meteorological environment, air emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, acoustic environment, human occupancy and resource use, social and cultural well-being, human health, infrastructure and services, employment and economy, and navigation and navigation safety. Subsequently, an update to the effects assessment or the cumulative effects assessment for the aforementioned elements as provided in Section 6.0 and Section 7.0 of the ESA [Filing IDs A4W2R0 and A4W2R6] has not been provided. 6.1 Soil and Soil Productivity Soil and soil productivity along the route revisions is similar to that described in Section 5.0 and Appendix 2A of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0 and ID A4W2S3] for the initial replacement pipeline route. The soil characteristics encountered during the 2016 field studies are similar to the characteristics previously described and are provided in Table 1 of Appendix O of the preliminary EPP [Filing ID A5D8Y1]. No new interests or concerns related to soil and soil productivity were identified as a result of the route revision locations (Table 2-1), 2016 soil sampling, recent consultation and engagement conducted, or Project-related Information Request responses. No new potential effects or cumulative effects were identified beyond those discussed in Sections 6.2.2 and 7.0 of the ESA [Filing IDs A4W2R0 and A4W2R6]. Mitigation measures for soil and soil productivity along the replacement pipeline route have recently been filed in the Project-specific preliminary EPP and EAS [Filing ID A5D8Y1 and A5D8Y2] and will be updated prior to construction, as required. The information gathered since the filing of the Application has been reviewed in the context of the ESA and it was determined there are no anticipated changes to the characterization of potential residual effects or cumulative effects or the evaluation of the significance of these effects and cumulative effects on soil and soil productivity (see Sections 6.2.2 and 7.2 of the ESA) [Filing ID A4W2R0 and A4W2R6]. 6.2 Water Quality and Quantity A summary of watercourse crossings that were updated as a result of the route revision locations and/or field surveys is provided in Table 6-1.

Supplemental vegetation surveys recorded the presence and abundance of weeds along the replacement pipeline ROW outside of active agricultural lands. In addition, a map of the potential weed risk was created for the entire route, and additional equipment cleaning sites were recommended. A late-season vegetation survey is planned for 2016. The potential residual effects and cumulative effects on weeds were previously assessed in Section 6.2.9 and Section 7.8 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0 and A4W2R6]. No new issues or concerns related to vegetation were identified as a result of the route revision locations (Table 2-1), 2016 field surveys, recent consultation and engagement conducted, or Project-related Information Request responses. MNCFN expressed an interest in collecting white pine needles in woodland areas prior to construction. As such, Enbridge committed to working with applicable landowners where tree removal is required and to coordinate access where the landowners will allow MNCFN representatives to collect white pine needles prior to pipeline construction. There are no new potential effects or cumulative effects identified beyond those discussed in Sections 6.2.9 and 7.8 of the ESA [Filing IDs A4W2R0 and A4W2R6]. Mitigation measures for vegetation, including species at risk and weeds, encountered along the replacement pipeline route have recently been filed in the Project-specific preliminary EPP and EAS [Filing ID A5D8Y1 and A5D8Y2] and will be updated prior to construction, as applicable. The information gathered since the filing of the Application has been reviewed in the context of the ESA and it was determined there are no changes to the characterization of potential residual effects or cumulative effects or the evaluation of the significance of these effects and cumulative effects on vegetation (see Sections 6.2.9 and 7.8 of the ESA) [Filing ID A4W2R0 and Filing ID A4W2R6]. 6.6 Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat All of the route revisions are minor deviations from the initial-filed replacement pipeline route. As a result, the habitat crossed by the route revisions is similar in characteristic and function to that described and assessed in Section 6.2.10 and Section 7.9 of the ESA [Filing IDs A4W2R0 and A4W2R6]. In general, the Project landscape is primarily agricultural, with cultivated and pasture lands comprising most of the habitat along the route revisions. Residual patches of dense forest, wetlands and watercourses are crossed, as described in Table 5-1 and assessed above in Sections 6.2 Water Quality and Quantity, 6.3 Fish and Fish Habitat, 6.4 Wetlands and 6.5 Vegetation. There are no new potential effects or cumulative effects identified beyond those discussed in Sections 6.2.10 and 7.9 of the ESA [Filing IDs A4W2R0 and A4W2R6]. Although the total length of the Project with the route revisions increases slightly and will have a slightly larger Footprint area (see Table 2-1), the updated Footprint should have a reduced effect on wildlife habitat. This is a result of the proportion of the Footprint in agricultural and disturbed land increasing with the route revisions, while the area of treed land (11.0 ha) and wetlands (5.5 ha) affected is reduced relative to the anticipated replacement pipeline route. The route revision between KP 11.2 and KP 12.4 and planned HDD crossing technique for Big Creek will reduce forest clearing and avoid habitat disturbance associated with the crossings of Big Creek and tributary to Big Creek along the initial replacement pipeline route. In addition, it is anticipated that the Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project OH-001-2016 Supplemental ESA - Part 1 of 3 Page 38 of 57 Filed August 15, 2016 ","SECTION 6.0 â ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECTS ASSESSMENT AND CUMULATIVE EFFECTS ASSESSMENT 6-6 CH2M HILL ENERGY CANADA, LTD. route revision from KP 8.6 to KP 9.9 and change from isolated crossings of the three watercourses along this segment to an HDD method, will further reduce disturbance to forest and riparian habitat. Field surveys completed during 2016 confirmed the occurrence of the following Significant Wildlife Habitats along the replacement pipeline route (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5 for a summary of field results): â¢ Assumed Significant Bat Maternity Roosting Habitat â¢ Significant Turtle Habitat and Significant Habitat for Snapping Turtle â¢ Breeding Bird Habitat (Significant Wildlife Habitat for Special Concern and Rare Wildlife Species, Significant Woodland Area-Sensitive Bird Breeding Habitat, and Significant Waterfowl Nesting Habitat and Marsh Breeding Bird Habitat) â¢ Significant Amphibian Breeding Habitat â¢ Assumed Jefferson Salamander Habitat An HDD construction method is proposed to avoid disturbance of the potential Jefferson Salamander habitat (see Section 6.7). The route revision segment of the pipeline between KP 11.2 and 12.4 will avoid interaction with the Stratum 2 deer wintering area associated with the Big Creek wetland complex. The deer wintering area is crossed by the Project in only one location (KP 14.1 to 14.2). This area is not a provincially designated Significant Wildlife Habitat. The results of field studies completed along the route revisions during spring and summer 2016 (Sections 4.0) and outcomes of consultation (Section 3.0) were used to refine mitigation that will reduce residual effects of the Project on wildlife and wildlife habitat. Updated mitigation was presented in the preliminary EPP and EAS [Filing ID A5D8Y1 and A5D8Y2]. The effect characterizations and significance determinations presented in Sections 6.2.10 and 7.9 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0 and A4W2R6] for residual effects on wildlife and wildlife habitat were reviewed in consideration of the route revisions, proposed HDD construction methods that are anticipated to avoid forest and wetland habitat alteration, and the refined mitigation developed in consultation with MNRF and informed by field results. The assessments of residual changes in wildlife movement, mortality risk, and habitat contamination from inadvertent spills remain unchanged from the ESA (i.e., immediate to short-term duration, low magnitude, reversible and not significant). The magnitude of the residual effect of habitat changes is reduced and in general will be low. However, the Project will affect Significant Wildlife Habitats that support species at risk, as well as more resilient species. Mitigation measures for wildlife and wildlife habitat have recently been filed in the Project-specific preliminary EPP and EAS [Filing ID A5D8Y1 and A5D8Y2]. With implementation of the mitigation measures, the magnitude of the residual effect of the Project on wildlife habitat remains low to medium, which is unchanged from the ESA. Therefore, the effect characterization and significance conclusion for residual changes to wildlife habitat remain unchanged from the ESA (medium to extended-term duration, low to medium magnitude, reversible and not significant). 6.7 Species at Risk 6.7.1.1 Fish and Fish Habitat There were no fish species at risk observed during 2016 field work. Although the locations of fish community surveys are within the mapped ranges for grass pickerel, 2016 field work confirmed that there is only one watercourse (WC 52) with the potential to support suitable grass pickerel habitat. There are no new interests or concerns related to fish and fish habitat identified as a result of the route revision locations (Table 2-1), 2016 field surveys, recent consultation and engagement conducted, or Enbridge Pipelines Inc.

Mitigation measures for aquatic species at risk encountered along the replacement pipeline route have recently been filed in the Project-specific preliminary EPP and EAS [Filing ID A5D8Y1 and A5D8Y2] and will be updated prior to construction, as applicable. The potential residual effects and cumulative effects on aquatics species at risk were previously assessed in Section 6.2.11 and Section 7.10 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0 and A4W2R6]. The information gathered since the filing of the Application has been reviewed in the context of the ESA and it was determined there are no changes to the characterization of potential residual effects or cumulative effects or the evaluation of the significance of these effects or cumulative effects on aquatic species at risk (see Sections 6.2.11 and 7.10 of the ESA) [Filing ID A4W2R0 and A4W2R6]. 6.7.1.2 Vegetation There were no new plant species at risk observed during the vegetation surveys completed in late May and June 2016. As noted in Section 4, butternut ( Juglans cinerea ), a species at risk, was recorded in multiple locations during the 2016 survey. The potential residual effects and cumulative effects on butternut were previously assessed in Section 6.2.11 and Section 7.10 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0 and A4W2R6]. The information gathered since the filing of the Application has been reviewed in the context of the ESA and it was determined there are no changes to the characterization of potential residual effects or cumulative effects or the evaluation of the significance of these effects or cumulative effects on vegetation species at risk (see Sections 6.2.11 and 7.10 of the ESA) [Filing ID A4W2R0 and A4W2R6]. 6.7.1.3 Wildlife The updated Project information, results of field surveys completed in 2016, and consultation outcomes were considered in context with the assessment of wildlife species at risk in Sections 6.2.11 and 7.10 of the ESA [Filing IDs A4W2R0 and A4W2R6]. There were no additional species at risk identified that have potential to interact with the Project. However, updated field survey results (Section 4.0) and consultation with MNRF indicates that some species at risk will not be affected by the Project. These are discussed further below. The ESA assessed the interaction of the Project with proposed critical habitat for eastern whip-poor-will ( Antrogstomus vociferous ) (Sections 6.2.11 and 7.10 of the ESA [Filing IDs A4W2R0 and A4W2R6]). Updated information and general consultation with MNRF confirms that the remnant forest patches in the Project area are densely treed and do not contain the matrix of open and half-treed areas that generally characterize suitable breeding habitat for eastern whip-poor-will (MNRF, 2013). There are no records of eastern whip-poor-will breeding in the LSA. As a result, the residual effect assessment in the ESA for eastern whip-poor-will is no longer valid, since the Project will not interact with this species. At the time of the ESA, there were no proposed or final critical habitats for any other wildlife species that would potentially interact with the Project (refer to Table 7.10-2 in the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R6]). Since the Project ESA was submitted to the NEB in December 2015, additional recovery strategies have been published. These are summarized in Table 6-2. Enbridge Pipelines Inc.

Recently Published Recovery Strategies and Identified Critical Habitat for Federally and Provincially Listed Wildlife Species at Risk Potentially Affected by the Line 10 Replacement Pipeline Federally and Provincially Listed Wildlife Species Recovery Strategies, Action Plans, Management Plans Identified Critical Habitat Mammals Little brown myotis, northern myotis and tri-colored bat Recovery Strategy for Little Brown Myotis ( Myotis lucifugus ), Northern Myotis ( Myotis septentrionalis ), and Tri-colored Bat ( Perimyotis subflavus ) in Canada (Proposed) (Environment Canada 2015a) Proposed critical habitat has been partially identified for these species. Any site where little brown myotis, northern myotis or tri-colored bat has been observed hibernating during the winter at least once since 1995 has been proposed as critical habitat (Environment Canada 2015a). The Project is not located in a 50 x 50 km standardized UTM square that contains proposed critical habitat (Environment Canada 2015a). Woodland vole Management Plan for the Woodland Vole ( Microtus pinetorum ) in Canada (Environment Canada 2015b) Critical habitat has not been identified for this species. Birds Barn owl Proposed Recovery Strategy for the Barn Owl ( Tyto alba ) Eastern Population in Canada (Environment Canada 2016a) Proposed critical habitat for this species is defined as: 1) a nesting or roosting site that has been used by a barn owl or was used by a barn owl at any time during the previous 12 months; 2) a barn, building or other structure, or a tree or other natural feature, on or in which a nesting or roosting site is located; 3) if a nesting or roosting site described in 1) is located on a tree or other natural feature, the area within 25 m of the base of the tree or other natural feature, and 4) those parts of the area within 1 km of an area described in 1) or 2) that provide suitable foresting conditions for barn owl (Environment Canada 2016a). Based on the best available information, there are no known occurrences of a nest or roost within the previous 12 months along the Project. Therefore, the Project does not interact with proposed critical habitat for this species. Canada warbler Recovery Strategy for Canada Warbler ( Cardellina canadensis ) in Canada (Environment Canada 2016b) Critical habitat has not been identified for this species. Common nighthawk Recovery Strategy for the Common Nighthawk (Chordeiles minor) in Canada (Environment Canada 2016c) Critical habitat has not been identified for this species.

This federal Recovery Strategy adopts the provincial Recovery Strategy for the Jefferson Salamander (Ambystoma jeffersonianum) in Ontario (Jefferson Salamander Recovery Team 2010) as Part 2 of the strategy. Part 2 is supplemented by a federal addition (Part 1) Critical habitat for Jefferson salamanders is defined as: (a) a wetland, pond or vernal or other temporary pool that is being used by a Jefferson salamander or Jefferson dominated polyploid or was used by a Jefferson salamander or Jefferson dominated polyploid at any time during the previous five years, (b) an area that is within 300 m of (a) and that provides suitable foraging, dispersal, migration or hibernation conditions for Jefferson salamanders or Jefferson dominated polyploids, (c) a wetland, pond or vernal or other temporary pool that would provide suitable breeding conditions for Jefferson salamanders or Jefferson dominated polyploids, is within 1 km of an area described by (a), and is connected to the area described in (a) by an area described in (d), and (d) an area that provides suitable conditions for Jefferson salamanders or Jefferson dominated polyploids to disperse and is within 1 km of an area described in (a) (Environment Canada 2016e). The Project is located within 10 x 10 km standardized UTM grid squares that contain critical habitat for Jefferson salamander (Environment Canada 2016e). Field studies confirmed there is no critical habitat in the locations surveyed; however, it is assumed suitable habitat exists until pre-construction surveys are complete (see Section 4.6 and further discussion below). Western chorus frog, Great Lakes/St. Lawrence â Canadian Shield population Recovery Strategy for the Western Chorus Frog ( Pseudacris triseriata ), Great Lakes/St. Lawrence-Canadian Shield population, in Canada (Environment Canada 2015c) Critical habitat has been partially identified for the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence â Canadian Shield population of the western chorus frog. The Project is not located in a UTM grid square containing critical habitat for this species (Environment Canada 2015c). There are no records of chorus frog occurrence in the Project area, and field surveys did not detect this species. Therefore, the Project will not interact with this species. Reptiles Blandingâs turtle Recovery Strategy for the Blandingâs Turtle ( Emydoidea blandingii ), Great Lakes/St. Lawrence population, in Canada [Proposed] (Environment Canada 2016f) Proposed critical habitat has been partially identified for the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence population of the Blandingâs turtle based on habitat occupancy and habitat suitability (Environment Canada 2016f). The Project is located in a 50 x 50 km standardized UTM square that contains proposed critical habitat (Environment Canada 2016f). Blandingâs turtles were not detected during field surveys for the Project (see Section 4.6 and further discussion below). Enbridge Pipelines Inc.

The Project is not located in a 50 x 50 km standardized UTM square that contains proposed critical habitat (Environment Canada 2016g). Therefore, the Project does not interact with proposed critical habitat for this species. Snapping turtle Management Plan for the Snapping Turtle ( Chelydra serpentine ) in Canada [Proposed] (ECCC 2016) Critical habitat is not defined for this species. Spiny softshell Recovery Strategy for the Spiny Softshell ( Apalone spinifera ) in Canada [Proposed] (Environment Canada 2016h) Proposed critical habitat has been defined for spiny softshell based on habitat occupancy, habitat suitability, and habitat connectivity. The Project is located in a 50 x 50 km standardized UTM square that contains proposed critical habitat (Environment Canada 2016h). However, general consultation with MNRF has determined that suitable habitat for spiny softshell does not occur along the Project route. Therefore, the Project does not interact with proposed critical habitat for this species. Wood turtle Recovery Strategy for the Wood Turtle ( Glyptemys insculpta ) in Canada [Proposed] (Environment Canada 2016i) Proposed critical habitat has been partially identified for this species, based on habitat occupancy and habitat suitability. Due to the sensitivity of location information, the proposed Recovery Strategy presents proposed critical habitat at a scale of 1:250,000 (NTS grids that contain critical habitat). Although the Project is located in one of these NTS grids containing proposed critical habitat for the wood turtle (Environment Canada 2016i), there is no suitable habitat for this species along the route. Enbridge has confirmed through general consultation with MNRF that the Project does not interact with wood turtle habitat. The final Recovery Strategy for Jefferson salamander partially delineates critical habitat for this species (Table 6-2). The Project is located within 10 x 10 km standardized UTM grid squares that contain critical habitat for Jefferson salamander (Environment Canada 2016e). Suitable habitat for Jefferson salamander does not exist in the areas where field surveys occurred, however it is assumed that suitable habitat exists where access was restricted. Updated mitigation, developed in consideration of field survey results and in consultation with MNRF, is provided in the preliminary EPP and EAS [Filing ID A5D8Y1 and A5D8Y2], which includes HDD construction methods to avoid potential Jefferson salamander habitat. This approach will avoid residual effects of the Project on potential Jefferson salamander habitat in the event it is identified during pre-construction surveys. In the event a trenched construction method is necessary, the proposed mitigation in the preliminary EPP [Filing ID A5D8Y1] will reduce the residual effects on this speciesâ habitat and movement, and will avoid Project-related mortality risk. Additional field surveys are proposed to confirm habitat for Jefferson salamander where land access was not Enbridge Pipelines Inc.

In the event that confirmed habitat for Jefferson salamander is affected by the Project, Enbridge will continue to consult with MNRF regarding mitigation. The effects assessment provided in the ESA for Jefferson salamander was reviewed in the context of this updated information. There are no changes to the residual effect characterization or significance conclusions provided in Section 6.11 or Appendix 2B of the ESA for this species [Filing ID A4W2R0 and A4W2T9]. The Project is located in a 50 x 50 km standardized UTM square that contains proposed critical habitat for Blandingâs turtle (Environment Canada 2016f). Field surveys were completed for the Project using the Blandingâs Turtle Protocol provided by the MNRF. This species was not detected during field surveys for the Project (see Section 4.4). Mitigation to protect Significant Turtle Habitat was developed in consultation with the MNRF and is provided in the preliminary EPP and EAS [Filing ID A5D8Y1 and A5D8Y2]. Mitigation includes trenchless (HDD) crossings of wetlands with confirmed over-wintering habitat for other turtle species. The effects assessment provided in the ESA for Blandingâs turtle was reviewed in the context of this updated information. There are no changes to the residual effect characterization or significance conclusions provided in Section 6.11 or Appendix 2B of the ESA for this species [Filing ID A4W2R0 and A4W2T9]. Updated Project details, recovery planning information, results of field studies and general consultation were used to refine mitigation that will reduce residual effects of the Project on wildlife species at risk and their habitat. Mitigation measures for wildlife species at risk and associated habitat have recently been filed in the Project-specific preliminary EPP and EAS [Filing ID A5D8Y1 and A5D8Y2] including specific measures to mitigate Project effects on Significant Wildlife Habitats and potential habitat for species at risk identified during field surveys. The information gathered since the filing of the Application has been reviewed in the context of the ESA and it was determined that there are no changes to the characterization of potential residual effects or cumulative effects or the evaluation of the significance of these effects and cumulative effects on wildlife species at risk (see Sections 6.2.3 and 7.3 and Appendix 2B of the ESA) [Filing ID A4W2R0, A4W2R6 and A4W2T9]. 6.8 Heritage Resources Archaeological fieldwork continues to be conducted along the anticipated replacement pipeline route, including the route revisions outlined in Table 2-1. Ongoing archaeological fieldwork will continue to be conducted in accordance with MTCS guidelines. Results of the Stage 2 and Stage 3 assessments will be used to update or develop resource-specific mitigation measures as needed; therefore, there are no changes anticipated to the potential effects on heritage resources that were previously identified in Section 6.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0]. Similar to Section 7.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R6], no potential cumulative effects on heritage resources were identified. Mitigation measures used to reduce potential effects on heritage resources are also outlined in Section 6.0 of the ESA as well as the Project-specific preliminary EPP [Filing ID A5D8Y1] and will be updated to include recommendations resulting from the archaeological assessments in order to reduce any potential effects, in the event heritage resources are discovered during construction. 6.9 Traditional Land and Resource Use Enbridge has implemented and continues to conduct Aboriginal engagement programs for the Project. Interests discussed during engagement opportunities and open houses since April 2016 are outlined in Section 3.0 and include deer hunting areas, medicinal plants, wildlife and vegetation species at risk, and water quality. The potential effects included in the ESA on traditional land and resource use [Filing ID A4W2R0] associated with construction and operations of the replacement pipeline were identified by the Enbridge Pipelines Inc.

Ongoing consultation and engagement efforts will continue to support Project planning, including any updates to the mitigation measures provided in the preliminary EPP. Considering that eastern white pine and deer are considered secure in Ontario (NatureServe, 2015), no new mitigation is warranted. Should protection measures be identified or suggested, Enbridge will consider the recommendations from Aboriginal groups, to the extent practicable. In the event that a traditional land and resource use site is discovered during construction, the Traditional Land and Resource Use Sites Discovery Contingency Plan in Appendix D12 of the preliminary EPP [Filing ID A5D8Y1] will be implemented. The information, including all interests outlined during recent engagement efforts (see Section 3), were reviewed in the context of the potential effects previously assessed and it was determined there are no anticipated changes to the identification or characterization of potential residual effects or the evaluation of the significance of these effects (see Section 6.2.14 of the ESA) [Filing ID A4W2R0].

Additional surveys are listed below. â¢ A late summer vegetation survey along the replacement pipeline ROW is planned for late August or early September 2016 to document locations containing vegetation species at risk and/or weeds. â¢ An additional watercourse assessment will be completed in August 2016 to confirm flow permanency at WC 19, WC 71, and WC 72. â¢ Soil, vegetation (e.g., rare plant and weed) and wildlife habitat (e.g., Jefferson salamander, bat cavity and turtle basking) surveys are planned in five locations where access has been previously restricted. Results of the additional surveys will be included in the EPP and EAS prior to construction, if warranted. 7.2 Updates to Mitigation Since the Project-specific preliminary EPP was filed on July 15, 2016 [Filing ID A5D8Y1], there have been no updates to resource- or site-specific mitigation measures along the replacement pipeline route. In the event that there are new or updated mitigation measures as a result of ongoing consultation and engagement or as a result of the supplemental studies planned along the route, Enbridge will file an updated copy of the EPP and EAS, if required.
