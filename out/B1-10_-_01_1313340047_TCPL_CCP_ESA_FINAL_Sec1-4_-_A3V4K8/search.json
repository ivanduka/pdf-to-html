["March 2014 WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment REPORT Report Number: 1313340047/6000/6001 Distribution: 1 copy TransCanada PipeLines Limited Calgary, AB 1 copy Golder Associates Ltd. Calgary, AB Submitted to: TransCanada PipeLines Limited 450 - 1st Street SW Calgary, AB T2P 5H1 ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 Executive Summary NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL), a wholly owned subsidiary of TransCanada PipeLines Limited (TransCanada), is applying to the National Energy Board (NEB) under Section 52 of the NEB Act for an order to authorize construction and operation of the proposed Wolverine River Lateral Loop (Carmon Creek Section) Project (the Project). NGTL commissioned Golder Associates Ltd. (Golder) to prepare this environmental and socio-economic assessment (ESA) report to meet the requirements and guidance of the NEB, including that in the NEB Filing Manual Release 2014-01 (NEB 2014). This ESA report also meets requirements of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (CEA Act 2012) (Government of Canada 2012), and is submitted to the NEB as part of the Section 52 Application for the Project. The Project is located in Northern Sunrise County northeast of the town of Peace River, Alberta . The proposed 60.5 kilometres (km) of 20 inch (508.0 millimetre [mm]) outside diameter buried pipeline will transport sweet natural gas to meet contracted customer requirements in the area for electrical and industrial processes. The Project will extend from an existing block valve site located in SW 08-91-16 W5M on NGTL’s existing North Central Corridor Pipeline (North Star Section), approximately 86 km northeast of the town of Peace River, to the site of the independently proposed Carmon Creek East Sales Meter Station located in NW 22-85-18 W5M, approximately 35 km northeast of the town of Peace River. The pipeline and valves installed in NW 25-88-18 W5M and SE 06-91-16 W5M are the only permanent Project infrastructure. NGTL proposes to use existing and future commercial and camp accommodations to house the temporary Project construction personnel. If necessary, NGTL will consider constructing an additional temporary construction camp in an existing clearing on Crown land near the Project footprint. The Project will parallel existing disturbance for 57.3 km or 94.8% of its length. For 55.6 km or 91.9% of its length, the Project will parallel existing pipeline rights-of-way (ROW) that are considered contiguous according to the NEB; that is, an electrical transmission line, an oil or gas pipeline, a railway or an all-season public highway. The Project footprint required for construction consists of new permanent ROW and temporary workspace (TWS). By using TWS on an existing ROW, the need for new ROW is minimized; this also results in a variable ROW width depending on the existing ROW paralleled. The minimum ROW width required for safe and efficient construction will be 27 metres (m), which includes 16 to 27 m of new permanent ROW. TWS is required at staging areas, crossings, sidebends, log decks, and where grading is necessary. No new permanent access is planned to support construction or operation of the Project. Access to the Project during construction will be primarily by existing highways and public roads, industry access roads, pipeline ROW, and the proposed Project ROW. Temporary access will use existing disturbances and only limited brushing will be required. The Project is entirely on Crown land and crosses forested land, wetlands, and the Cadotte River and Little Cadotte River sub-basins of the Peace River basin. The Project crosses 12 watercourses, six of which are impounded by beaver activity near the crossing location. The Project also crosses approximately 44 hectares (ha) of wetlands (approximately 24.3% of the Project footprint) of which 7 ha are non-peaty (mineral) wetlands, ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 36 ha are peatland (organic) wetlands, and 1 ha is shallow non-vegetated open water. Two segments of the Project, for distances of approximately 6 km and 3 km, cross a Key Wildlife and Biodiversity Zone (KBWZ). The design, construction and operation of the Project will comply with all applicable codes, standards and regulations. Subject to regulatory approval, construction is scheduled to commence in November 2015, with an expected in-service date in April 2016. For construction activities occurring in the KWBZ Restricted Activity Period (RAP) of January 15 to April 30, NGTL will adhere to requirements determined in consultation with Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development (ERSD), which will be outlined in a KWBZ Protection Plan. Preparation of the ESA included desktop, which were conducted for all environmental and socio-economic elements considered in the effects assessment, and field studies for specific elements. Appropriately timed field studies were conducted in 2013 and 2014 for the following environmental elements:  wildlife surveys, including reconnaissance level, remote camera, and winter track surveys;  vegetation and wetlands surveys, including reconnaissance level, listed plants, and noxious weeds surveys; and  aquatic and fish habitat surveys, including watercourse crossing location surveys. Supplemental field work to support vegetation, wildlife and fisheries assessments has been recently conducted or is planned during the appropriate seasons in 2014 to support the ESA. Traditional Land and Resource Use (TLU) helicopter flyovers, TLU community sessions and ground-based surveys were conducted in winter 2014, and TLU studies will continue into summer 2014. The Project encounters no previously recorded historic resource sites, and lands in the Project footprint have low potential for as yet unrecorded historic resource sites. However, lands with potential for historic resources occur close to the Project crossing of the Cadotte River, and a Historical Resources Impact Assessment (HRIA) for the Project is planned for spring 2014. Supplemental reports presenting the results, and environmental and social assessment based on these additional studies, will be submitted to the NEB in separate discipline-related reports before or in August 2014, depending on the timing of the study. The supplemental data will be used to confirm the appropriateness of the environmental protection measures currently planned for the Project and, if necessary, to plan additional protection measures specific to the Project. The socio-economic assessment considered the traditional, recreational and industrial activities occurring in Northern Sunrise County and the town of Peace River. The potential effects on the communities, including Aboriginal communities, and on infrastructure and services, were assessed based on introducing the Project workforce, which is expected to reach 475 persons at the peak of construction. The potential environmental effects associated with the Project are those typically encountered during pipeline construction and operation in a forested setting in the Green Area of Alberta. Similarly, potential socio-economic effects are those typically identified in association with pipeline construction projects in northern Alberta. Project-specific mitigation will be implemented by NGTL to avoid or reduce potential adverse effects during construction and operation. The environmental protection measures designed to mitigate potential environmental ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 effects are presented in the Environmental Protection Plan (Appendix A) and on the Environmental Alignment Sheets (Appendix B) of this ESA. Mitigation as set out in this ESA will also be implemented to alleviate potential adverse socio-economic effects, and will include safety protocols, accepted industry construction and operations standards, adherence to all applicable regulations, order, and permitting conditions, and ongoing consultation with Aboriginal communities and other stakeholders. The design and implementation of TransCanada’s environmental compliance strategy – including environmental protection planning and implementation, environmental inspection and monitoring, and post-construction monitoring and follow-up – is expected to avoid or mitigate potential adverse environmental and socio-economic effects. Assessment of the potential environmental and socio-economic effects resulted in the prediction that any adverse residual Project-related and cumulative effects will be not significant.

(NGTL), a wholly owned subsidiary of TransCanada PipeLines Limited (TransCanada), is applying to the National Energy Board (NEB) for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) under section 52 of the NEB Act to authorize construction and operation of the Wolverine River Lateral Loop (Carmon Creek Section) Project (the Project) (Figure 1.0-1). NGTL commissioned Golder Associates Ltd. (Golder) to prepare an environmental and socio-economic assessment (ESA) to meet the requirements and guidance of the NEB, including that in the NEB Filing Manual (NEB 2014). This ESA report is submitted to the NEB as part of the section 52 Application for the Project. The Project is located northeast of the town of Peace River, Alberta. The Project involves the construction and operation of a new buried pipeline to transport sweet natural gas, and will include approximately 60.5 kilometres (km) of 508 millimetres (mm) Nominal Pipe Size 20 (NPS 20) pipe and valve sites.  The Project will extend from an existing block valve site located in SW 08-91-16 W5M on NGTL’s existing North Central Corridor (NCC) Pipeline (North Star Section) approximately 86 km northeast of the town of Peace River to the site of the proposed Carmon Creek East Sales Meter Station located in NW 22-85-18 W5M, approximately 35 km northeast of the town of Peace River. NGTL has filed a separate application under section 58 of the NEB Act to build the Otter Lake Compressor Station at the block valve site (NEB Application A56099). The compressor station is required to meet contracted demand for natural gas in the area independent of the Project. If the compressor station is not approved or built at the time of construction for the Project, then the Project will tie in to the existing block valve. In the alternative, if the compressor station is approved and built at the time of Project construction, the Project will tie in to equipment at the same block valve site within the fenced compressor station site. The Carmon Creek East Sales Meter Station will also be applied for under separate section 58 NEB Act application, and is required to meet contracted demand for gas in the area independent of the Project. The Project crosses Crown land in the Green Area of Alberta, including 12 watercourses, six of which are impounded by beaver activity near the crossing location. The Project footprint required for construction consists of both new right-of-way (ROW) and temporary workspace (TWS). The Project parallels existing disturbance for 57.3 km or 94.8% of its length, and the ROW is considered contiguous by the NEB (i.e., parallel to an electrical transmission line, an oil or gas pipeline, a railway or an all-season public highway) for 55.6 km or 91.9% of the route. By using TWS on existing ROWs, the need for new ROW is minimized; this also results in a variable ROW width depending on the existing ROW paralleled. The minimum space required for construction will be 27 metres (m), which includes 16 to 27 m of new permanent ROW. In addition to the permanent ROW, the Project footprint includes TWS at staging areas, crossings, sidebends, log decks, and where grading is necessary.  Existing highways and public roads, industry access roads, pipeline ROW, and the proposed Project ROW will be used to access the Project. Temporary access will use existing disturbances, and only limited brushing will be needed. No new permanent access is planned to support the Project. This document has been prepared in accordance with the NEB Act and the NEB guidance, including the Filing Manual , Release 2014-01 (NEB 2014), as part of NGTL’s application for approval of the Project. The ESA has also been prepared to meet the requirements of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (CEA Act 2012). Subject to regulatory approvals, pipeline construction is scheduled to commence in November 2015 with the pipeline scheduled to be in-service, and the operation phase to commence in April 2016.

","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 2-1 2.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION This section describes the Project, identifying the purpose and need for the Project and alternatives to the Project, Project location, Project components and Project phases. The Project is located on Crown land in the Green Area of Alberta in Northern Sunrise County, northeast of the Town of Peace River, Alberta. The Project will include construction of approximately 60.5 km of 508.0 mm (NPS 20) pipe and associated valve sites.  The Project will extend from a block valve located in SW 08-91-16 W5M on NGTL’s existing North Central Corridor Pipeline (North Star Section) approximately 86 km northeast of the town of Peace River, to the site of the proposed Carmon Creek East Sales Meter Station located in NW 22-85-18 W5M approximately 35 km northeast of the town of Peace River. The Project parallels existing linear disturbances (i.e., pipeline ROW) for the majority of its length (i.e., 57.3 km or 94.8%). 2.1 Purpose and Need for the Project The purpose of the Project is to meet customer requirements for sweet natural gas in the area for electrical and industrial processes. Firm Delivery (FT-D2) contracts have been executed to support the Project. 2.2 Alternatives to the Project Alternatives to the Project are defined as functionally different ways to meet the need and achieve the purpose of the Project (CEA Agency 2007, 2013). Only buried pipeline options realistically meet the Project need and purpose, while being technically and economically feasible to implement. There are no existing pipelines that provide a feasible alternative for transportation between the tie-in points. This is because of capacity restrictions due primarily to existing pipeline size. Therefore, there are no realistic alternatives that meet the Project need and purpose. NGTL evaluated whether an alternative route could meet the Project need and purpose. The Project route selection process is discussed in Section 2.3 of this ESA. 2.3 Pipeline Route Selection Route selection is one of the primary mitigation options for avoiding conflict between the Project and environmental, socio-economic, and historic resources, as discussed in Section 2.3.2. The following factors were considered when determining a potential route for the Project. 2.3.1 Initial Pipeline Route Selection Section 5.3, Description of Facility Alternatives, in the Project Application describes how a facility solution connecting NCC (North Star Section) and the Cadotte River Lateral (South Flow alternative) is required to increase delivery capability in the Peace River Project Area. Two options paralleling the existing NGTL Wolverine River Lateral (WRL) were considered, with both routes paralleling WRL in the same south to north corridor for approximately 46.2 km. Where the routes deviate, Option A continues north, paralleling WRL for an additional 23.5 km, and crosses Jackpine Creek and Little Cadotte River (69.7 km total route length). Option B follows an existing Shell pipeline corridor North East for an additional 14.3 km (60.5 km total route length). Option A was eliminated as a viable alternative due to its additional route length and crossing of two additional named watercourses. Option B was advanced as the preferred route and is addressed by this assessment. ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 2-2 2.3.2 Control Points NGTL selected its proposed route for the Project based the following primary control points: Source Control Points Existing Valve Site on NCC (North Star Section) SW 08-91-16 W5M Delivery Control Point Proposed Carmen Creek East Sales Meter Station (independent application) NW 22-85-18 W5M 2.3.3 Routing Considerations In addition to the control points, NGTL considers the following factors:  paralleling existing linear disturbances to:  reduce the potential fragmentation of wildlife habitat;  maximize the amount of TWS located on existing ROW or other existing disturbances; and  reduce the amount of new (non-parallel) ROW required.  reduce the development of new access into remote areas;  reducing the number and complexity of watercourse crossings;  avoiding or reducing effects on identified environmentally sensitive areas (e.g., wetlands);  avoiding or minimizing routing through areas of unstable terrain;  avoiding lands of designated status such as parks, cemeteries, reserves under the Indian Act , and known historic sites;  input from Aboriginal communities, stakeholders and landowners;  ensuring the facilities are economical to construct and operate;  consulting with regulatory agencies to understand issues that may need to be addressed in the routing process;  avoiding routing near urban development and residences;  reducing the number of road crossings, particularly of highways and paved roads;  ensuring construction feasibility of watercourse and road crossings along the selected route; and  optimally locating the pipeline corridor within producing areas to maximize potential for future connections. 2.3.4 Pipeline Route Selection Considerations and Rationale The route selection process for the Project involved a desktop review of the area including high resolution digital imagery and LiDAR, in addition to helicopter reconnaissance, ground verification and field surveys, and engineering, geotechnical, and environmental field studies. The Project start and end points were determined by the locations of valve installations on existing NGTL pipelines, minimizing the length of new construction, and ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 2-3 minimizing environmental effects. NGTL’s routing strategy was to install the pipeline parallel to existing linear disturbances to the extent feasible. The NEB considers a contiguous ROW to be equivalent to a “new right-of-way” as defined in the Regulations Designating Physical Activities of the CEA Act 2012 (CEA Act 2012) (Government of Canada 2012) (i.e., “new right-of-way” means land that is subject to a new right-of-way that is proposed to be developed for an electrical transmission line, an oil or gas pipeline, a railway or an all-season public highway and that is not alongside and contiguous to an existing right-of-way). The Project has been aligned with existing ROW, including NGTL and third-party ROW, considered contiguous for 55.6 km (91.9%) of its length. The Project follows other existing disturbance (e.g. industry access road, seismic, facility) for an additional 1.7 km, thus paralleling disturbances for a total of 57.3 km (94.8%) of its length. For the remaining 3.2 km (5.2%) of its length, the Project does not follow existing disturbances. 2.4 Project Components The pipeline and associated valve sites are the only planned permanent facilities for the Project. Associated operational components will include in-line inspection launcher and receiver facilities, a cathodic protection system (new or upgrades to an existing system), and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) System (if required during detailed engineering design). Temporary facilities include TWS for construction activities and temporary infrastructure (e.g., pipe storage yard, construction camp, temporary access). 2.4.1 Pipeline and Valve Sites The Project will include 60.5 km of 508 mm (NPS 20) pipe and valve sites.  The Project will extend from an existing block valve site located in SW 08-91-16 W5M to the independently proposed Carmon Creek East Sales Meter Station.  A block valve will be installed at approximately kilometre post (KP) 34 in NW 25-88-18 W5M. This site will also include crossover valves to the existing NGTL Wolverine River Lateral. A second crossover valve site located at approximately KP 58 will connect to the existing NGTL Hunt Creek Lateral in SE 06-91-16 W5M. Access to the valve sites will be by permanent ROW or helicopter. Access to pipeline locations during construction will be primarily by existing roads, including Highway 688 and 986, other existing access roads, industry access roads (Licence of Occupation [LOC]) and pipeline ROW (Pipeline Agreement [PLA]), as well as the Project ROW. New temporary access to water sources is proposed to support construction of the Project. Temporary access will use existing disturbances and only limited brushing will be required. No new permanent access is planned to support the Project. Shoo-flies (temporary access roads) to the pipeline ROW may be required in specific locations along the pipeline route. The Project is located on Crown land and crosses forested land, wetlands, the Cadotte River and Little Cadotte River sub-basins of the Peace River basin. The Project crosses 12 watercourses: five unnamed permanent watercourses located in the Little Cadotte River watershed, six unnamed small permanent watercourses located in the Cadotte River watershed, and the Cadotte River. Technical details for the Project are presented in Table 2.3-1. The Project footprint required for construction consists of both permanent ROW and TWS. The Project requires a minimum construction ROW width of 27 m for safe and efficient construction, which can be comprised of new ROW or a combination of new and existing ROW for workspace. Through use of existing ROW, the new permanent ROW is as little as 16 m in many areas. In addition to the construction ROW, site-specific TWS will be required at highway, road, pipeline and watercourse crossings, log deck sites, truck turn-arounds, and other locations to accommodate pipeline ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 2-4 construction activities. The construction ROW will be reclaimed after construction and maintained for pipeline operation. The total area of the permanent ROW will be 109.6 hectares (ha). Additional areas, totalling up to 72.5 ha, will be required for TWS for construction activities and staging areas. The total area of ROW and TWS (i.e., the Project footprint) will be approximately 181.1 ha. The locations and areas of ROW and TWS are shown on the Environmental Alignment Sheets (Appendix B).

TransCanada has material specifications for all pipeline components, which outline the engineering requirements for these commodities, including any certification or testing requirements. Materials are only purchased from suppliers that have been qualified by TransCanada, and critical engineering components require third party inspection to verify that the product meets TransCanada’s requirements. ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 2-5 2.4.2 Associated Components Other components associated with the pipeline include the following:  In-Line Inspection (ILI) Facilities – Launcher and receiver facilities for in-line inspection will be installed.  Cathodic Protection – A cathodic protection system will be installed. Facilities could include new, or upgrades to existing, anode beds, rectifiers, and associated facilities. The scope of the cathodic protection system will be addressed during detailed design.  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) System – The Project may include the installation and operation of a SCADA system to allow for remote monitoring and control of valves (if required based on detailed engineering design). The Project SCADA system will be connected to TransCanada’s Operations Control Centre (OCC) located in Calgary. This centre is staffed 24 hours per day. 2.4.3 Temporary Facilities The following temporary facilities will require temporary use of lands during Project construction:  TWS – for crossings, side bends, log decks, and grading during pipeline construction;  Staging areas – for equipment and fuel storage, and muster points during construction; and  temporary construction camp(s) to accommodate Project personnel during construction. All temporary facility sites will be reviewed from an environmental perspective by NGTL prior to use, and reclaimed as part of the post-construction reclamation activities. TWS is planned at specific locations, including pipeline crossing of watercourses and roads, as well as side bends, log decks, staging areas, and where grading is required. The amount of TWS will be limited to the extent practical, and existing clearings will be used to the extent available. 2.4.4 Temporary Construction Camps NGTL has applied to construct a temporary camp for the proposed Otter Lake Compressor Station Project (Otter Lake Project) under a separate NEB section 58 application. The temporary camp will be located at the north end of the proposed Project ROW, on part of the Pipeline Installation Lease (PIL) for the Otter Lake Project, in SW 08-91-16 W5M. Upon completing construction of the Otter Lake Project in Q3 2015, the temporary camp will be used by the pipeline Project. The Project will use the temporary camp for approximately 50 personnel, who will work on ROW preparation activities, such as clearing, grading, and frost-packing from November 2015 until mid-January 2016. The temporary camp for the Otter Lake Project is located in an ESRD designated Key Wildlife and Biodiversity Zone (KWBZ) that has a Restricted Activity Period (RAP) that begins in mid-January. As this RAP starts as clearing activities near completion, NGTL proposes to close the camp following clearing, grading and frost-packing activities to limit NGTL’s presence during the RAP. Should the camp be kept open during the RAP, it would not be sufficient to lodge the full workforce for the Project during peak construction, which NGTL estimates will include up to 475 personnel from mid-January to mid-February 2016, and as such will not be used past ROW preparation activities. ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 2-6 NGTL is reviewing available hotel and rental accommodations in Peace River and existing open construction camps in the south end of the Project area that may provide accommodation for the peak Project workforce which will construct the Project from south to north. It is anticipated that existing and future commercial and camp accommodations will be sufficient to house the Project workforce.  NGTL will continue to monitor vacancy rates for rental, commercial and camp accommodations in Peace River and near the Project.  If necessary, NGTL will consider constructing an additional temporary construction camp in an existing clearing on Crown land near the Project footprint. The Project will be responsible for demobilization of the camp constructed for the Otter Lake Project, and any other camp constructed for the Project, including all camp modular structures and associated facilities (i.e. generators, fuel tanks, and water tanks). 2.5 Construction The following sections describe the pipeline construction activities, workforce, and schedule. 2.5.1 Pipeline Construction Activities The pipeline is the only permanent facility planned as part of the Project. The standard activities associated with pipeline construction are described in Table 2.5-1. Table 2.5-1: Activities Associated with Pipeline Construction Pipeline Construction Phase Description of Activity Engineering Design The Project will follow the requirements of the latest version of Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Standard Z662, Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems (CSA Z662) and will be in compliance with the latest version of the National Energy Board (NEB) Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR). Surveying Line-of-sight clearing with chain saws (as required), flagging, and staking of the proposed construction right-of-way (ROW), any temporary workspace (TWS), and marking of the trench line and any utilities. Surveying also involves marking of any sensitive areas to be avoided during construction such as rare plants or habitat, and historic resources. Clearing Removal of snow, trees, shrubs, and other obstacles from the construction footprint. Merchantable timber will be harvested and made available according to commercial use agreements. Other salvageable timber will be made available according to use agreements. Equipment used for clearing activities includes chain saws, rotary grinders, feller-bunchers, hydro-axes, mulchers or other tree-clearing equipment, as well as skidders, dozers, and backhoes. Stripping / Salvage Strippings will be salvaged at areas where grading is necessary. The area stripped is to correspond to the area to be graded. Equipment used during strippings handling activities includes dozers, graders, and backhoes. Grading Grading may be required at some locations to establish a level and safe working surface. Grading follows strippings salvage and uses backhoes and dozers. Stringing and Welding Sections of pipe will be transported to the ROW by trucks from a stockpile site, ideally located south of the Project. The pipe will then be field bent, lined-up, welded, joint-coated, and inspected, prior to being lowered into the trench. Equipment used includes pipe trucks, booms, bending machines, pick-up trucks, and x-ray or ultrasonic inspection equipment mounted on pick-up trucks or skids. Trenching The trench for the pipeline will provide a minimum cover of 0.9 m to top of pipe and a typical trench width of approximately 1.5 m. Excavated subsoil material will be stored adjacent to the trench, on the spoil side of the ROW. Trenching will likely be done with tracked excavators and wheel ditchers. Pipe lowering Welded pipe sections will be lowered into the trench by sideboom tractors and/or backhoes. Trench dewatering may be required prior to lowering-in the welded pipe. Weights and/or screw anchors may be installed with the pipe in wetland areas or areas with a high water table, where applicable. ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA Table 2.5-1: Activities Associated with Pipeline Construction (continued) March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 2-7 Pipeline Construction Phase Description of Activity Backfilling After the pipe has been lowered, the trench will be filled with the previously excavated spoil and crowned over the trench. Equipment used will consist of backhoes, graders, dozers or specialized backfilling equipment. Watercourse Crossings Watercourse crossing methods will be decided in consultation with engineering and environmental specialists. Crossing methods typically used during watercourse construction include dry or frozen open-cut crossings, and isolated (i.e., dam and pump, flumes) crossing techniques. Clean-up and Reclamation Final clean-up and reclamation procedures will be initiated following construction, once weather and soil conditions permit, using bulldozers, backhoes, and graders. The ROW contours will be returned to a stable and maintenance free condition. The strippings, where salvaged, will be replaced, with cross ditches and diversion berms installed on moderate to steep slopes to reduce the risk of erosion. Erosion prone areas will be seeded with an appropriate native seed mix and special reclamation measures will be applied, where warranted. Waste Disposal The anticipated Project wastes are typical pipeline construction wastes, such as scrap materials, used lubricants, welding rods, and domestic garbage. Project operations are also expected to produce used lubricants, oily rags, and chemical containers. All waste will be disposed of at an approved site or, in the case of the chemical containers, returned to the supplier. The contractor, in accordance with NGTL’s Waste Management Plan, will handle waste management and disposal during the Project. Pipeline Integrity Validation and Testing NGTL will validate the integrity of the new pipeline through CSA and/or NEB approved methods prior to commissioning the pipeline. This will be accomplished using non-destructive examination and hydrostatic tests when the pipeline is filled with water to a pressure beyond normal daily operating pressures. Emergency Response Plan NGTL will have an emergency response plan for the Project that meets or exceeds regulatory requirements. NGTL currently has operations in the area, and will adapt its response plans to include the Project.  NGTL will communicate with emergency response personnel in the area and work co-operatively to link company emergency plans appropriately into plans maintained by other affected agencies. 2.5.2 Inspection NGTL will retain the services of a qualified Environmental Inspector for the duration of construction. The Environmental Inspector will monitor construction activities and confirm the implementation of protection measures outlined in NGTL’s documentation, including the EPP and Environmental Alignment Sheets (Appendices A and B of this ESA). 2.5.3 Workforce Requirements The total construction workforce is expected to be a maximum of 475 persons, including supervisors and inspectors, over the course of the Project construction. During pipeline operation and maintenance, there will be no increase in the workforce as operation and maintenance activities associated with the Project will be performed by existing NGTL personnel or contractors. 2.5.4 Schedule The Project schedule has been developed based on receipt of all required regulatory permits and approvals to construct and operate the pipeline with an in-service date in April 2016. Engineering design and planning activities are ongoing and are expected to continue, including the procurement of materials, until major construction commences in November 2015. Estimated dates for the construction and operation and ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 2-8 maintenance activities of the pipeline are provided in Table 2.5-2. NGTL requests NEB approval by September 2015 to facilitate the proposed start of construction of the Project on November 1, 2015. Winter construction provides the most suitable conditions in the terrain crossed and avoids the most sensitive timing periods for wildlife such as migratory songbirds and trumpeter swans. It is anticipated that construction will be necessary in KWBZs that occur from approximately KP 14 to KP 20 and KP 57 to KP 60 of the Project (refer to Section 5.8.3 – Wildlife Areas and Acts) during the RAP for KWBZ from January 15 to April 30. A KWBZ Protection Plan to address this occurrence is being developed in consultation with ESRD and will be finalized prior to construction. NGTL will initiate clearing activities in the KWBZ as early as possible when construction starts and will work expeditiously to limit winter activities. Ongoing consultation with ESRD will be maintained to manage necessary work activities in the KWBZ.

TransCanada operates the NGTL System pursuant to an Operating Agreement between TransCanada and NGTL. NGTL applies TransCanada policies in its operations of the NGTL System that are common to NGTL’s operation of other federally-regulated pipelines. For the Project, NGTL will develop and implement a Post-construction Monitoring (PCM) program to assess the effectiveness of mitigation and reclamation measures on soils, vegetation and watercourses disturbed during construction of the pipeline. NGTL will conduct monitoring and prepare maintenance plans to address any identified potential adverse environmental effects. NGTL has systems in place to manage the safe operation and integrity of its existing facilities. These programs will be applied to the Project. The new pipeline and valves will be covered by integrity management plans ensuring that the on-going requirements of this pipeline and facilities are met throughout their respective service lives. Internal inspection is an integral part of NGTL’s Integrity Management Program and the proposed in-line inspection facilities will be designed to allow passage of various types of in-line inspection including cleaning tools and high and low resolution in-line inspections tools. NGTL has Operation Procedures that describe how its pipelines are operated and maintained. The Operations and Procedures Manual provides detailed information on ROW maintenance, including information on Alberta One-Call, aerial reconnaissance, pipeline crossings, road usage, pipeline signage, brush control, and weed control. This manual will be expanded to include work completed for the Project. 2.6.1 System Protection and Controls The Project facilities will be controlled from the OCC in Calgary, operated by TransCanada. The OCC is staffed 24 hours per day and uses a computer-based SCADA system to continuously monitor and control pipeline operations. The pipeline control system will monitor pipeline flows, pressures, temperatures and equipment status continuously. The SCADA system will alert the OCC operator of significant operational changes of the pipeline system. Status and control information will be received by the SCADA system. 2.6.2 Maintenance Activities that occur during regular operation and maintenance of the pipeline include the following:  aerial pipeline inspection;  placing pipeline markers at roads and watercourse crossings;  vegetation management;  cathodic protection monitoring (where warranted);  in-line inspection; and  SCADA monitoring. ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 2-10 2.6.3 Public Awareness NGTL will follow the TransCanada Public Awareness Program to educate key stakeholders about living and working safely near pipelines. The program is holistic in nature, and is designed to inform the affected public, excavators and contractors, emergency officials, and local public officials of facility locations and operational activities to:  protect the public from injury;  prevent or reduce effects on the environment;  protect the facilities from damage by the public; and  provide an opportunity for ongoing public awareness. The Public Awareness Program provides safety messaging on leak recognition and response, and damage prevention awareness including the message to ‘call before you dig’. The Project consultation and engagement program is described in Section 3. 2.7 Decommissioning and Abandonment The Project has been designed to operate for 30 years or more. Decommissioning and abandonment activities will comply with all applicable federal and provincial regulatory requirements. Any decommissioning and abandonment activities will require the approval of the NEB and other applicable agencies. These approvals will be applied for at the time of decommissioning planning. ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 3-1 3.0 PROJECT ENGAGEMENT 3.1 Principles and Goals of the Consultation and Engagement Program The stakeholder engagement program was designed and conducted in accordance with the principles of TransCanada’s community relations best practices. The goals of the consultation and engagement program are to:  build, maintain, and enhance a positive reputation for TransCanada, regardless of the status of the Project;  gather, understand, consider, and integrate stakeholder issues and concerns into Project design and execution as appropriate;  provide feedback to stakeholders on how their input was integrated into the ESA or on the rationale for not integrating it; and  enable the development and maintenance of positive relationships with stakeholders by encouraging them to do the following:  learn about Project activities;  engage in the consultation process; and  be involved in addressing potential issues or concerns that might be identified through the consultation and engagement process. 3.2 Design of the Consultation and Engagement Methods A number of methods have been used to inform the public, obtain feedback and identify issues related to the Project, including the following:  Project-specific Information Package, which includes a fact sheet and Project map;  National Energy Board – Fact Sheet – January 2014;  personal contacts with stakeholders, including face-to-face meetings;  newspaper advertisements;  public notices;  Project-specific website;  Project e-mail box;  Project toll-free telephone number; and  mail-outs to provide updates throughout the life of the Project. The consultation and engagement program for the Project is implemented in phases using open communication and participatory community involvement practices. Consultation and engagement phases I through IV are outlined below. ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 3-2 Phase I – Stakeholder Identification and Material Development This phase of consultation and engagement focuses on the identification of possible interested/affected stakeholders in the Project area and the development of high level consultation and engagement materials including stakeholder letters, maps and informational fact sheets, to be used for project notification purposes. The initial project information distribution list is developed in this stage and is updated regularly as additional stakeholders are identified. Phase II – Stakeholder Notification This phase focuses on the first wave of initial project notification to stakeholders identified in Phase I. This notification contains some high level details relating to the Project, including proposed facility locations and key Project related activities, as well as information on how stakeholders can provide input into the project planning and NEB regulatory review process. Phase III – Ongoing Stakeholder Outreach and Regulatory Filings This phase consists of ongoing stakeholder consultation, engagement, and communication including the distribution of additional project information (mail-outs), project advertising, telephone contact, and face-to-face meetings. The purpose of this continued outreach is to keep stakeholders informed about the Project’s progress, to continue to solicit feedback about the Project and to identify and address issues. Phase IV – Post Filing through Construction This consultation and engagement phase will continue through the regulatory review process and if approval is granted, until the completion of construction. Stakeholders will be informed of the NEB’s decision and advised of any pre-construction and construction activities. During this phase, NGTL will respond to inquiries and emerging issues; resolve issues carried over from Phase III activities; and continue to communicate with all stakeholders. NGTL will update stakeholders regularly as Project milestones are met and will seek their continued feedback and input. This phase will conclude with the completion of construction, at which point consultation and engagement activities will be transferred from the project team to TransCanada’s Integrated Public Awareness Program, through its Land, Aboriginal and Community Relations group, to ensure ongoing stakeholder communication and issue resolution as required during operation. 3.2.1 Stakeholders TransCanada engages with a broad range of stakeholders, including:  Aboriginal communities;  municipal leaders and representatives (e.g., municipal districts, counties, rural municipalities, cities, towns, villages);  provincial and federal elected officials;  government agencies and representatives;  other non-governmental organizations;  lease holders;  landowners;  land users; and  other interested stakeholders. ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 3-3 3.3 Consultation and Engagement Outcomes Information gathered during the consultation and engagement program has been considered and incorporated in the ESA where relevant, including the effects assessment and mitigation and enhancement measures. With this information, NGTL identified issues, addressed concerns, and responded to questions raised by stakeholders. Engagement has also provided communities and regulators with an understanding of the Project’s potential effects. Project-specific concerns raised to date have been addressed, and mitigation agreed to as appropriate. 3.4 Aboriginal Engagement 3.4.1 Engagement Activities Conducted To Date The Aboriginal engagement program for the Project is guided by TransCanada’s Aboriginal Relations Policy. The program is designed to assist NGTL in planning the Project. NGTL has made efforts to incorporate any potential concerns by Aboriginal communities in the region. Initial engagement of Aboriginal communities began in August 2013. The following First Nations communities have been engaged on the Project:  Woodland Cree First Nation (WCFN);  Lubicon Lake Band (LLB);  Duncan’s First Nation (DFN);  Whitefish Lake First Nation (WLFN);  Loon River First Nation (LRFN); and  Horse Lake First Nation (HLFN). The following Métis Settlements communities have been engaged on the Project:  Métis Nation of Alberta (MNA);  Métis Nation of Alberta – Region 5 (MNA Region 5);  Métis Nation of Alberta – Region 6 (MNA Region 6);  Cadotte Lake Métis Local 1994 (CLML 1994);  Gift Lake Métis Settlement (GLMS); and  Peavine Métis Settlement (PVMS).

","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 3-4 As a result of engagement with Kapawe’no First Nation, NGTL further contacted Sawridge First Nation to determine engagement for the Project. The LLB and the WCFN provided Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) information during environmental field programs in fall 2013. The LLB provided TEK information during the fisheries surveys on September 29 and October 1 and 2, 2013. The WCFN provided TEK information during fisheries surveys on October 4, 2013. Meetings were held with the Aboriginal communities to discuss the approach to conducting TLU and TEK studies, and ROW flyovers. Duncan’s First Nation (DFN) provided TLU and TEK information during a ROW flyover and a TLU community workshop held on January 22, 2014. The LLB provided additional TLU and TEK information during a ROW flyover and TLU community meeting held on January 28, 2014. The CLML 1994 provided TLU and TEK information during a ROW flyover and a TLU community workshop held on January 23, 2014. The WCFN provided TLU and TEK information during a ROW flyover held on January 24, 2014. A community meeting was also held with WCFN on February 13, 2014 to discuss the Project, community concerns, and the approach for conducting TLU and TEK studies. 3.4.2 Key Comments, Concerns and Interests Aboriginal Interest and Concerns Communities have expressed concern about health and safety (e.g., emergency preparedness, spraying for vegetation control), potential increase in predation of wildlife, location of the pipeline in relation to burial sites, and an interest in opportunities to participate as environmental monitors for the Project (Section 5.14). An Aboriginal engagement summary report of potential issues, concerns and interests is provided in the application for the Project. Supplemental TLU and Aboriginal engagement may result in the identification of new Project-specific issues, which may require mitigation. As a result of the initial engagement and meetings held in January and February 2014, NGTL is working with the Aboriginal communities to schedule additional meetings in March or April 2014 to discuss their project-specific concerns and mitigation agreed to as appropriate. A summary of potential issues and concerns is provided in Section 5.14 and in the Aboriginal Engagement section of the application for the Project. Results of the consultation and engagement program have been considered and incorporated through the ESA where relevant, including the effects assessment and mitigation and enhancement measures. NGTL has made efforts to incorporate any potential concerns by Aboriginal communities in the region. NGTL will continue to work with communities to ensure areas of concerns are reasonably and appropriately mitigated. Public Concerns and Interest NGTL has initiated consultations with local municipalities and communities with generally positive outcomes to date. While some concerns are being expressed, such as Northern Sunrise County’s concern regarding the transportation of workers during construction and a preference for coordinated bussing of construction personnel to the worksite, NGTL is working to evaluate preferred scenarios with the intent of developing mutually satisfactory plans to address these concerns. NGTL anticipates continued positive and collaborative consultations throughout the planning period of the Project, and through all phases of the Project. A full description of the Stakeholder Engagement Program, results and status of engagement is presented in the Stakeholder Engagement section (Section 12) of the section 52 Application document. Concerns raised to date, or potentially raised, are also addressed as appropriate throughout this ESA in Traditional Land and Resource Use (Sections 5.14 and 6.15), Quality of Life (Sections 5.15 and 6.14), Human Health (Section 6.15), and Infrastructure and Services (Section 6.16). ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 4-1 4.0 ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECTS ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY This section describes the approach and methods used to carry out the assessment of environmental and socio-economic effects for the Project. The Project is described in Section 2 of the ESA and Section 2.0 of the Application. The methodology was developed based on the NEB Filing Manual , Release 2014-01 (NEB 2014) using Guide A – Facilities Applications (NEB Act section 52 and section 58), section A.2 (Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment). The methodology for this ESA involves the following steps:  describe the existing environmental and socio-economic setting (i.e., baseline conditions) in which the Project will be constructed and operated;  determine the environmental and socio-economic Valued Components (VC) and associated key indicators that may interact with the Project;  determine the temporal and spatial boundaries of interactions between the Project and the VCs;  conduct the project-specific effects assessment, including identification of potential project effects, recommended mitigation, evaluation of residual Project effects, and determination of their significance;  conduct a cumulative effects assessment for the Project in combination with other reasonably foreseeable projects and activities; and  identify any follow-up and monitoring programs that will be undertaken post-construction to evaluate effectiveness of planned mitigation and address environmental issues identified during Project operation. 4.1 Describing the Existing Environment The description of the existing environment includes all the environmental or socio-economic elements that were considered when determining which aspects of the environment may potentially be affected as a result of the Project. The environmental baseline, describing the environment and socio-economic elements as they are now, is the basis for determining the incremental change and likely environmental and socio-economic effects associated with the proposed Project. The following sources were used to prepare the baseline section:  review of available topographic and resource maps, aerial imagery, databases, scientific papers, technical reports, government websites, interactive websites, information letters, and fact sheets;  Project-specific field investigations;  environmental applications prepared for other projects in the area; and  communication with Aboriginal groups, local land users, representatives from local and regional governments, provincial and federal regulators, and the general public. The study methods and the existing environmental and socio-economic setting in which the Project will be constructed and operated are described in Section 5. ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 4-2 4.2 Determining Valued Components and Key Indicators The assessment of effects on the environment focuses on the environmental and socio-economic elements prescribed to be considered in the NEB Filing Manual (NEB 2014). All elements, referred to as VC in this ESA, considered relevant to this ESA are described in Section 5; however, only those identified as having possible interactions with the Project were scoped into the assessment and described in further detail in Section 6. To focus the effects analysis for each VC, one or more key indicators were selected. A key indicator represents a primary issue related to the VC that has the potential to change as a result of the Project, and can be described as an aspect or characteristic of the VC that, if changed as a result of the Project, may result in an effect on the VC. The assessment is focused on key indicators that have environmental or socio-economic importance as identified by the Project team through a variety of means, including the following:  stakeholder consultation;  discussion with regulators;  literature and database review;  information from previous environmental assessments for projects proposed under similar environmental conditions; and  the experience of TransCanada personnel and their consultants. The identified scientific or community issues or concerns regarding the Project are represented by key indicators which have the potential to be affected by the proposed Project. A number of factors, including the following, influenced the selection of key indicators:  the sensitivity or vulnerability of the key indicator;  the uniqueness or rarity of the key indicator;  the sustainability of the key indicator;  the value attributed to the key indicator by stakeholders;  recognition of the importance of a key indicator by a statute, policy, regulation, or court;  risks to the health, safety or well-being of people; and  the likelihood of an indirect effect on an associated key indicator (i.e., a link exists between the affected key indicator and another key indicator such as water quality affecting fish habitat). The VCs and key indicators selected to address the issues identified in relation to this Project, the rationale for their selection, and associated expressions of change are presented in Table 4.2-1.

engineering design and planning, construction, operation and maintenance, and decommissioning and abandonment. The temporal boundaries for the effects assessment encompass the construction, operation and maintenance, and decommissioning and abandonment phases of the Project. The construction phase is scheduled to begin in November 2015, and the pipeline is scheduled to be in-service and the operation phase to commence in April 2016. A detailed Project schedule is presented in Table 2.5-2, Section 2.5.4. The Project has been designed to operate for 30 years or more. Consequently, the operation and maintenance phase of the Project is expected to continue until beyond 2046. Project decommissioning and abandonment effects are addressed, as warranted, in Section 6.0 following the effects assessment for the construction, and operation and maintenance phases. NGTL’s proposed decommissioning and abandonment activities for the Project are provided in Section 8.7. 4.3.2 Spatial Boundaries The spatial scope of the assessment was determined based on the extent of potential direct and indirect environmental and socio-economic effects on a given VC resulting from the Project. This assessment uses the following spatial boundaries as described in Section 5.1 and shown in Figures 5.1-1 and 5.1-2:  Project footprint;  Local Study Areas (LSA);  Regional Study Areas (RSA); and  Socio-economic Study Area (SSA). 4.4 Project-specific Effects Assessment The Project-specific effects assessment evaluates the environmental and socio-economic effects of the construction, operation, and decommissioning and abandonment phases of the Project. A step-wise process is used to assess the environmental effects of the Project in a systematic and transparent manner once the relevant Project works and activities, assessment boundaries, and relevant environmental and socio-economic VCs are identified. The assessment method includes the following steps:  conduct an initial screening of potential Project-environment interactions;  identify potential environmental and socio-economic effects;  develop technically and economically feasible mitigation;  predict likely residual effects following implementation of mitigation; and  evaluate (i.e., describe and determine the significance of) the predicted residual effects. ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 4-10 4.4.1 Initial Screening of Project-Environment Interactions The first step in the assessment process is to identify the likely Project-environment interactions at a screening level. The screening approach allows the assessment to focus on the issues of key importance. All relevant Project works or activities are analyzed individually to determine if there is a plausible interaction that could cause an effect on each VC during normal Project conditions. The analyses are based on professional judgement and experience of the ESA team with regard to the physical and operational features of the Project and their potential for interaction with the environment. The results are summarized in a matrix illustrating where the Project may potentially interact with each VC and where adverse environmental or socio-economic effects are likely or possible. The interactions identified in the matrix are used to focus the description of the existing environment (Section 5) and the assessment and mitigation of potential effects (Section 6). 4.4.2 Identification of Potential Environmental and Socio-Economic Effects The effects assessment considers the potential interactions between the Project infrastructure components and activities and the VCs, in the identified spatial and temporal boundaries. Project interactions may be direct (i.e., as a result of a Project infrastructure component or activity affecting a VC), or indirect (i.e., as a result of a change to one VC affecting another VC). Potential effects of the Project on the key indicators are determined by describing the existing environmental and socio-economic setting (i.e., baseline setting) in the Project footprint and study areas and comparing the baseline conditions to those which are expected to result from the introduction of the Project. In addition to assessing the potential Project effects on VCs, the assessment considers effects of the environment on the Project (e.g., climate change, severe weather, wild fires). 4.4.3 Identification of Mitigation Development of mitigation to reduce or avoid potential effects on key indicators begins with the engineering design phase, and continues throughout the route selection, planning, assessment, and consultation and engagement activities for the Project. Refinements are made as specifics are identified and the Project and cumulative effects assessment is conducted. Mitigation is outlined in the effects assessment (Section 6) with reference to the Project specific EPP (Appendix A), including Environmental Contingency and Management Plans (Appendix A – Annexes E and F), and other industry standard practices and regulatory requirements. 4.4.4 Prediction of Likely Residual Effects An effect is considered to occur where anticipated future conditions resulting from the Project differ from the conditions otherwise expected from natural change. In some situations, the recommended mitigation will eliminate a potential adverse effect while in other situations the measures will lessen, but not eliminate, the effect. Any adverse effect that will be eliminated, or is considered unlikely after mitigation, is not identified as a residual effect and is not considered further. Any adverse effect that may remain after the application of feasible mitigation is identified as a residual effect.

Ecological context may also be relevant when describing an adverse effect on biological and some socio-economic VCs. Ecological context relates to the potential for Project effects to cause disruption of ecological functions in relation to the receiving environment, which may be ecologically fragile with little resilience to imposed stresses or may be already adversely affected by human activities. Where relevant, a statement regarding ecological context will be included in the description of residual effects. The definition of effect levels comparable to each criterion can vary from one key indicator to another, recognizing that the units and range of measurement are distinct for each. The criteria used to describe a predicted residual effect are defined in Table 4.4-1. These criteria were considered in combination by the assessment team to assess the importance of an adverse residual effect on a key indicator. Importance of the Predicted Residual Effect The assessed importance of the predicted residual effect for each key indicator is primarily based on the combination of magnitude, geographic extent, and duration of the effect. The frequency of an effect is often implicit in the definition of effect magnitude or duration. The probability of occurrence is considered primarily in the case of assessing risk, such as in the case of accidents and malfunctions. The combination of criteria used to describe a predicted residual effect, and to assess the level of importance of the residual effect on key indicator are provided in Table 4.4-2.

The amount of time between the start and end of a Project activity or stressor (which relates to Project development phases), plus the time required for the effect to be reversed. Duration and reversibility are functions of the length of time a key indicator is exposed to Project activities. Reversibility is an indicator of the potential for recovery of the key indicator from the Project effect. Reversible implies that the effect will not result in a permanent change of state of the key indicator compared to “similar” environments not influenced by the Project (similar being an environment of the same type, region and time period). For effects that are permanent, the effect is determined to be irreversible.  Short-term – the effect occurs during construction and is reversible during operation  Medium-term – the effect occurs during construction and/or operation and is reversible at abandonment  Long-term – the effect occurs during construction and/or operation and persists beyond abandonment, but is reversible  Permanent – the effect occurs during construction and/or operation and is irreversible  Short-term – the effect occurs during construction and is reversible during operation  Medium-term – the effect occurs during construction and/or operation and is reversible at abandonment  Long-term – the effect occurs during construction and/or operation and persists beyond abandonment, but is reversible  Permanent – the effect occurs during construction and/or operation and is irreversible Frequency Frequency refers to the occurrence of the effect over the duration of the Project. Discussions on seasonal considerations are made when they are important in the evaluation of the effect.  Infrequent – the effect is expected to occur rarely  Frequent – the effect is expected to occur intermittently  Continuous – the effect is expected to occur continually  Infrequent – the effect is expected to occur rarely  Frequent – the effect is expected to occur intermittently  Continuous – the effect is expected to occur continually Probability Probability of occurrence is a measure of the likelihood that a Project activity will result in an effect.  Unlikely – the effect is not likely to occur  Possible – the effect may occur, but is not likely  Probable – the effect is likely to occur  Certain – the effect will occur  Unlikely – the effect is not likely to occur  Possible – the effect may occur, but is not likely  Probable – the effect is likely to occur  Certain – the effect will occur (a) An effect that poses a management concern can require action such as research, monitoring or a recovery initiative.

The predicted residual effects for each key indicator are assessed using a combination of criteria, professional judgement and these definitions as guidelines. Table 4.4-3: Definitions of the Assessed Levels of Importance of Predicted Residual Effects Level Definition Negligible Predicted effect may result in a change in the resource, but is not detectable or measurable. Low Predicted effect may result in a detectable change in the resource. Research, monitoring, or recovery initiatives would not normally be considered. Moderate Predicted effect is expected to result in a detectable change in the resource, but is not expected to threaten the sustainability of the resource. Management actions such as research, monitoring or recovery initiatives may be considered. High Predicted effect is expected to result in a detectable change that could threaten the sustainability of the resource and should be considered a management concern. Management actions such as research, monitoring or recovery initiatives should be considered. 4.4.5.2 Determination of Significance The determination of significance of adverse residual effects generally followed the guidelines and principles of the NEB Filing Manual (NEB 2014), the Federal Environmental Assessment Review Office (1994), and the Cumulative Effects Assessment Practitioners Guide (Hegmann et al. 1999). These agencies identify several possible methods for the determination of whether residual adverse effects are significant, including the use of established environmental standards, guidelines or objectives in relation to potential residual effects, as well as quantitative and qualitative assessment of the residual effects. The determination of significance of adverse residual effects applies to each VC, considering the following:  combined assessed levels of importance of the residual effects on key indicator using ecological and socio-economic principles;  sustainable development objectives; and  professional judgement and experienced opinion. Maintaining the integrity of ecological and socio-economic systems and protecting biological and social resources is based on an understanding of the functioning of natural and social systems. Ecological and socio-economic principles such as natural cycles, interdependence and networks, and diversity and resilience are considered throughout the effects assessment and specifically in assessing the significance of an identified effect on a biological or socio-economic resource. Sustainable development (i.e., satisfying the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs) in the context of this ESA is based on established public objectives (e.g., land use plan or policy; government commitment on the use and conservation of resources; legislation, regulation or guideline) to preserve environmental integrity, improve social equity, and improve economic feasibility. ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 4-16 The evaluation of significance involves the professional judgment of experienced specialists. The ESA team is comprised of technical specialists with experience collecting data and assessing environmental and socio-economic effects for numerous projects in Alberta. The team understands the Project scope, the landscape, environmental sensitivities, communities and types of environmental and socio-economic issues commonly encountered across northern Alberta, and those specific to this Project during construction, operation and decommissioning. Based on the application of the significance criteria, a significance conclusion is made for each VC. The possible significance conclusions are defined in Table 4.4-4. Table 4.4-4: Definitions of the Significance Determination of Predicted Residual Effects Significance Definition Biophysical Not significant The effect might be detectable, but is not predicted to result in a change that will alter the sustainability of the Valued Component (VC) beyond an acceptable level. Significant The effect is measureable, and is predicted to result in a change to the VC that will alter its sustainability beyond an acceptable level. Socio-economic Not significant The effect is measurable at the individual, family, or community level, and strong enough to be detectable at the population level, but is not expected to result in substantial change in the well-being of defined populations and communities. Significant The effect is clearly distinguishable and can result in strong interest or concern, or results in substantial change in the well-being of defined populations and communities. 4.4.5.3 Prediction of Confidence Prediction of confidence in the Project effects assessment refers to the degree of certainty of the residual effects prediction and associated evaluation of environmental significance. The environmental assessment deals with predictions of future circumstances, and predicts interactions of the Project and other developments or activities with complex biophysical and socio-economic environments. Therefore, the effect predictions vary in their level of certainty, which is influenced by factors such as:  availability of data relevant to the environment in the study area;  natural variability and resiliency of the environment and society;  degree of scientific understanding of Project and VC interactions, and VC interrelationships; and  other factors beyond the control of the Project assessment team. The level of certainty was considered during the effects assessment. Where there was a high degree of uncertainty, conservatism was built into the assessment so that the predicted effect would not be underestimated. ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 4-17 4.5 Cumulative Effects Assessment In addition to the assessment of environmental or socio-economic effects of the Project by itself, the assessment also considers the environmental effects of the Project in combination with those of other projects and activities that have been, or will be, carried out and which may interact with the residual effects of the Project. The Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEA Agency) defines cumulative effects as the sum of residual effects from all past, current and reasonably foreseeable projects or activities on the physical, biological, cultural and socio-economic components of the environment (Hegmann et al. 1999). The CEA Agency recognizes that while each single land-use change may result in a relatively negligible effect, the accumulation of these changes over time and space could cause a significant effect. The CEA Agency aims to determine the interaction of these individual developments to determine how a given project will influence not only the project site or area, but the entire region over time. The steps used to consider cumulative effects are based on the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency’s Cumulative Effects Practitioners Guide (Hegmann et al. 1999) and CEA Agency (2013) guidance, and include the following:  identify adverse residual Project effects;  define spatial and temporal boundaries for each VC where adverse residual Project effects have been identified;  identify other projects in the area with similar (additive) effects likely to overlap the predicted residual Project effects;  identify potential spatial and temporal interactions between the VC and the Project in combination with other projects or activities;  develop additional mitigation, if warranted, and predict likely combined (cumulative) effects; and  evaluate and determine the significance of the likely cumulative effects. Regarding future projects and activities, emphasis was focused on those that are certain to proceed or are reasonably foreseeable. If residual Project effects on a key indicator are predicted, the VC that it represents is carried forward into the cumulative effects assessment. For a VC where no residual Project effects are anticipated, the VC is not carried forward for further analysis. For a VC where residual effects were identified, it is necessary to determine if the effects from the Project interact temporally or spatially with the effects from one or more additional developments or activities. When Project activities or disturbances interact spatially and temporally, their combined effects may differ in nature or extent from the effects of individual Project activities. Cumulative effects also include natural influences on biophysical and socio-economic components prior to, during and after development of the Project (e.g., extreme rainfall events, periodic harsh and mild winters, economic changes that are independent of the Project). It is the goal of the cumulative effects assessment to estimate the contribution of these types of effects, in addition to Project specific (incremental) effects, to the amount of change in the key indicator and therefore the VC. ","WOLVERINE RIVER LATERAL LOOP (CARMON CREEK SECTION) ESA March 2014 Report No. 1313340047/6000/6001 4-18 Typically, the potential effects of malfunctions and accidents are not included in the cumulative effects assessment because these events are hypothetical and have a low probability of occurrence. This is consistent with the CEA Agency’s Cumulative Effects Practitioners Guide (Hegmann et al. 1999) which acknowledges that such events are ‘rare” and should be assessed as ‘unique scenarios”, as their potential effects are too extreme to be assessed together with those caused by normal Project activities. In this ESA, cumulative effects are identified, analyzed and assessed in Section 7. The method of cumulative effects assessment follows the same general approach used for the Project effects assessment and determination of significance outlined in Sections 4.3 and 4.4. 4.6 Inspection and Monitoring The EPP (Appendix A) identifies the roles and responsibilities of all workers on the Project (including NGTL, contractors and consultants), and describes the mitigation to be implemented to reduce or avoid the potential adverse environmental effects of the Project. The EPP includes mitigation, including Environmental Contingency and Management plans, as well as other industry standard practices and regulatory requirements. Contingency plans have been included in the EPP to deal with unforeseen Project effects (e.g., accidental spills, discovery of unknown heritage resources). Inspection and monitoring (Section 8) will be carried out through the duration of the Project to guide the implementation of the mitigation, and to monitor its effectiveness. The inspection and monitoring will:  identify unanticipated potentially adverse effects, including possible accidents and malfunctions;  evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation and modify or enhance measures as necessary;  verify the accuracy of the assessment of the predicted residual effects; and  contribute to continual improvement.
